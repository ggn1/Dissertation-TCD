this app, 1 star is actually more than it deserves. I had the app loaded for a while, but found that either dogs lived too far away from me or my attempts to connect went unanswered. Then the app began to crash every time I opened it. I've tried uninstalling & reinstalling it several times with the same frustrating results. I reported the issue, but haven't heard back from anyone yet. I just want to find a playmate or two for my dog....Ughhhhh!"", ""A VERY big portion of the dog owners that use this app are a bit too far from me, so I can't really schedule playdayes with this app, (which is weird, since I live in NYC). However, this app serves as a MASSIVE upgrade from Google Maps, since it allows me to find dog runs, dog parks, and other dog friendly places much more easily, which I think is fantastic."", ""I absolutely love the Barkhappy app! As a dog owner, it's always nice to connect with other dog lovers in my area and this app makes it so easy to do. I've made some great connections and have even met up with other dog owners for playdates. The app is also great for finding dog-friendly restaurants and events. Highly recommend for any dog lover looking to connect with others and find fun things to do with their furry friend."", 'This is a fantastic, well-built app, I just wish it was more popular! Hard to find dogs within a reasonable driving distance for me, especially ones that are active. Hopefully as word gets out and more people discover this app, that situation will improve.', ""I've met some great people and some amazing dogs on here!! The only downside is you can't look up dogs by age. Most dogs can't keep up with my puppies energy level. I waste a lot of time looking for dogs her age hoping to find another high energy puppy."", ""So far I really like the app! It's easy to use and not too intrusive. However there's really no one in my area :( I live in Eastern WA. So maybe you guys could do an ad campaign for the PNW? There are loads of dogs up here (with more coming all the time)."", 'Almost un-useable with the popups, and might have some security issues where it randomly attaches images from my gallery when I try to provide feedback.', 'Definitely an issue with lack of people on here - I live in a 9 million person metropolis, and have only 2 dogs within a 10 mile range of me. The low stars are for the app itself though; spammy, business rather than dog oriented, weird configurations, a lame ripoff of Facebook. I guess I see why not many people sign up.', ""I want it so bad but I can't get through the create a profile stage. Bug about uploading main pic, even when 3 have been uploaded."", ""Seems to be a great app but there's no doggies close to my town to schedule play dates.. maybe advertise it more would really help?

Thank you so much for fixing my issue!', ""Loving this app so far! Haven't met any other pups yet but I love the map tool!

Overall, I highly recommend Barkhappy for any dog owner looking to explore new places with their pup.', ""It's facebook for your dog! I been using the app for 4 years. I originally was an ambassador in Baltimore but now we are in Richmond where its not as active or popular yet. Hoping to change that like I did in my old area in MD and help grow it in VA so we can get some events here too!"", 'Great app but I do find it a little bit weird that it asks for your relationship status.

Closes if you deny it location permission.  Too shady for me to trust them.', ""This is a fantastic app for dog lovers & those with furbabies! Setting up a profile was easy & took just a few minutes. I'm new to Arizona, having moved here a year ago, and have had a rescue for the last 7 months. So it's been super helpful in getting to know the area, finding places I can bring my dog to when I'm out & about, and I've met some great people. It's always great seeing them at the events after interacting with them on the app!"", ""It's pretty useless unless you create a profile which it won't let you do without pictures which it won't accept when you try to upload! Yay for wasted time and data, but they got my email address so they can spam me to death. I'm sure that's the main focus anyway!"", ""This is a good way to meet other dog lovers in your city. There are always events posted and you can find other dogs near you and set up playdates with them. I appreciate that there is also a Lost and Found alert that could be super helpful. I'm relatively new to Austin and I've met some really great people through the app. Really fun events too!"", ""I liked this app a few months ago, but now they force you to create an account, and worst of all, the use push notifications that can't be disabled!

It is also great for finding local dog friendly events!', ""Great way to meet other dogs & dog owners in your area. Also can find out about dog friendly locations or events, both of which  I'm always on the lookout for. 😊"", ""Requires WAYY too much information when signing up. Also, selecting the (required) photo doesn't work well. After selecting image in Google Photos, nothing happens (no image is actually selected). Had to download manually select from device. Update: Thanks to the devs for the reply. I'd suggest making it easier to omit information (or mark as private) during sign up. Also, the servers have been really slow lately.

I like that you can add businesses and dog friendly places yourself."", ""I can't believe how many establishments in my area that are pet friendly. What a great app. Thanks for the tips"", 'Bark Happy is wonderful! This is the perfect app for dog lovers looking for fun pet friendly events in their area. Very helpful to find all the dog friendly hangouts and businesses too!', 'I like it but I think they should add a section for dogs that can be rescued', 'I just downloaded the app.  I set up my dogs profile and reviewed dogs near me.  I was disappointed in the map.  It is inaccurate.  It shows Washington Square Mall on the north side of Washington Ave when in actuality it is on the south side.  There is a new grocery store and pet store on the north side that I am unable to tag.  The county Humane society was not listed on the app.   Not user friendly to add the info. To the correct location. It would be much easier with satellite view.', ""Such a helpful app, especially for finding places to go with your pups. I spent two hours one time with my small dogs and family trying to find a place where they were allowed, and most places still wanted them to sit outside where the ground was extremely hot. We finally found a place we had to drive much farther away for, but looking at this app now, there's so many places we would have been allowed nearby. The events and socializing abilities are a huge plus!"", 'Porter (my dog) and I didn\'t even know how much we longed for something like this in our lives!

and enjoy it. I like the ample opportunities to earn diamonds and money. This is refreshing in comparison to other games that make it nearly impossible to obtain either without spending real money. Thank you. The game is a little glitchy with the dogs either running in place, jerky movements, moving too fast. You may want to iron these glitches out.', 'This game is great! It is a great app to show parents that you can take care of a dog, or for fun! I love everything about it, however it is slightly buggy .. an add pops up sometimes during the tutorial and it still gives me the tutorial but no option to close the add so I have to do it by guessing where everything is. other than that, Awsome game!', ""Love the game, but it's pretty glitchy. Graphics are great, there's always something to do, real money isn't needed to advance, it's a cute and addicting game that all ages can enjoy. I do wish there was more you could do with the dogs though, like an outside yard, go on exciting walks, dog clothes choices, i also wish breeding was a little more genetically accurate as well, and i wish that the dogs were more size-accurate. All in all, it's a 10/10 with room to improve 😁"", ""The game has a cute style for its models: a satisfying semi-realistic approach. I was curious to see what the game could offer, however I basically wasn't able to get any further than naming my dog as the game freezes upon nearly any action afterwards."", ""This game is an absolutely amazing game that works on and offline! I love this game the dogs are Soo cute and it takes like 3-4 minutes to get four puppies!!! This game does have some things that cost money though like the exclusive pack. But I still suggest that you get this game because it can entertain you for hours if you let it! Wonderful game for road trips or long plane rides! Setting it up doesn't take long. Download it today!!!"", ""This is a great game, for kids, teens and adults!!! Though this game is fantastic I almost have all the dogs, maybe making a cat version of the game would be super cool!!! Just a suggestion I'm sad I almost have finished the game ):"", ""Back when i was a kid, i always used to play this game, and it was so much fun! The old classic dog game. It has no annoying ads, but this one? It had alot of ads, for every quest, every oven, every tab there is an ad, and if i watched an ad for a free pack, it wasn't working now! I watched an ad, but i didn't receive the rewards. Look, i know the effects of the pandemic caused alot of downhill to most companies, but please, maybe reduce the amount of ads? It's ok if no,iunderstandwhyyoucouldnt."", ""It's a fun game and it has cute dogs but I don't like the random ads that pop up and the fact that after you breed and spin the wheel it still shows all the dogs you already have but other then that it's fun to play."", 'Super cute, so many nice animations for a free game. Not many ads at all. But the game keeps crashing unfortunately.', 'Well this game is really fun but it can get a little boring 💤 but it is interesting there are different types of dogs and u can breed them and u can feed and brush and bath the dogs well I totally recommend this game for u well tgats all 👋.', 'Very fun it confused 😕 me at first but just click on the brush treat and sponge 🧽 icon to do it but it is fun to breed and 👀 see what you get. They look so realistic.', ""I love this game the dogs are so cute but when I tried to buy more room to put my dog in the room it took my money but it didn't give me more room at all and it happen twice and sometimes there are pop up ads and it does get bothering after a few time"", ""I get many of the same ads and that gets very annoying but other then that it's a very fun game in my point of view yall should check it out"", 'This game is cute, but it does get a bit irritating sometimes. Like, a helping guide would be useful, explaining the purpose of every single thing in the game. Training of the puppies is also confusing. They will move quite rigidly. The puppies need more movement flexibility. Kindly do something to make the game run like butter because it is the only cutest game of puppies, and I love it.', ""It's a lovely game, but the ads are really obstructive and annoying. I dont mind an ad every like, 20 mins or so but I'm literally getting them every 5 minutes and each time I get them the game crashes. Please sort the ads out and it will make the experience much more pleasant. x"", ""Holy Ads, this game is unplayable! Ads every 30 seconds, it's insane!!"", ""I love this game its fun and so cute what I'm not happy about though are the constant ads and having to pay 8.99 a week for subscription to drop ads and get perks. It's too expensive for a game on my phone."", ""I love this game it online but it's fun because you can decorate furniture And you can collect puppy and feed them. They will grow big and you can pet Them."", ""This is an amazing game to let off steam and it is exactly what I needed, but there is one awful problem with this game. I deleted the first time I got it because my phone was clogged up, but then I tried to re-download and it had deleted all of my progress. I was on one of the highest levels which I worked extremely hard to get, and now I have to restart which really puts me off. This game would without doubt be 5-stars if it weren't for this annoying mistake. Please fix this 🙏🏻."", ""I love this game I got so many dogs and it's kinda hard but the dogs are so cute 😍 💓"", ""I love this game I play it all the time! But now whenever i start the game it doesn't let me in, it says an error has occurred. But besides that (it won't let me in no matter what I do) it's still a good game, oooo adding a newfoundland and irish wolfhound would be awesome!"", ""It's unfortunately quite buggy. I think it's a super fun(ny) game and would love to play more. But I can put in a lot of time's work which includes watching a bunch of ads (which makes you money) and when I come back, all of that work will be undone (dogs are unleveled, my tokens are gone, etc). May have to uninstall if it persists."", ""This game is awesome but it takes forever to load like when I first got it,it loaded fast but I've had it for 2 week's now and it kinda changed so when you get in it takes forever and then you get into the game and this is why I gave it a 4 star rating I hope this helps."", ""Just like fun because it's cute seeing alot of puppies running around"", 'This game is fun lol I love dogs, but there is some ads', ""I really like this game, but I think there are too much ads and bugs. the part that i think can be improved: 1. There are too many ads, like when you want to move room or when you want to collect food (without doubling it). Maybe it's better if you put ads just to get rewards. ex: for packs or speed up things or respin 2. When i watch ads to get double food, it's become 0 not double 3. I think this game is good for children, but some ads in this game is a bit inappropriate for children. Thanks"", ""Only played this for another game, but not even twenty minutes in I had it uninstalled. The game itself is pretty good. Great animation, adorable dogs, and it's not glitchy too. However, I can't deal with the amount of pop-ups that take up the entire screen—all of which you can't exit for ten seconds each. I understand that you might need the ad money, but how about giving us optional ads for boosts/speed ups or something. I'm pretty sure so many others are also annoyed by these endless ads."", ""It's a good game, really, but I wish there were more things to train the dogs. I feel like we should be able to train working dogs' service dog tasks and things like that. More things related to the breed of dog instead of all of them being the same."", ""Logged into the game just fine but there is no dog and I can't go into the little dog store to get a dog cuz they're all locked I went to every section on everything on the screen that I could and could not figure out where this dog is someone please explain to me if I'm doing anything wrong"", 'I breed my dogs but then when i come to complete the breeding it like the breeding never happen but when you try to find the dog . It say it still is in breeding . 6 of my best dogs are supposedly still in breeding but when I hit the nest it just gives me the option to breed again .', 'I really love this app as it is a dog game I thought this was not good but turn out to be great! 💯 The dogs breed is alot! I really like that Totally worth to trying to get Ur dog in the game my dog is a shi Tzu and there is in the game thanks that is totally extra credits for the dog town game recommended', ""This is the best game ever. There aren't excessive ads, you can get diamonds easily, you can get gold easily, and the dogs are adorable."", ""I absolutely LOVE this game! It's fun, adorable, and it teaches young children how to take care of dogs! I love how there are no ads. 10/10 would recommend."", ""This is a really bad game I mean u can't even enter it 😞. For the first time before I entered it I thought that it'd be sooo fun but I couldn't even enter it. It's really just a fake game😒😕. Soooo not fun 😕. If there was an option I would give it zero stars 😒. I really wish that I could play this game."", ""I love this game. It's pretty, cute, friendly and intuitive. One that even the older can appreciate and help them relax. I just think there could be a way to make it less visualy stressing (with a high number of visual elements on the screen later on, with tons of quests pilled and all that)."", 'I like it but I wish they had a Foxe dog in the game thanks for listening', ""It's a really fun game and I sure do enjoy playing it. However, there is a few issues I have come across. It has way to many glitches, it freezes a lot and it sure does have to many adds. The glitches that it is having...the dogs when they move all of a sudden it's like ether the dogs or the game are freezing."", ""This is my favorite game and I will love this game forever good job on making this game I can't wait for games just like this KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!"", ""I love everything about this game except for spinning the wheel when you have a love story. I literally spun the wheel 10 times in a row watching an ad between each spin to try to get a different breed and more than half the time hit the same exact breed and color for one I already have. This has been a consistent problem and generally makes the game frustrating and not fun to play. I've considered uninstalling multiple times because of this coding choice and now I'm done unless it's fixed."", 'Nice game but too many ads and too lengthy. Mostly at least 30 seconds. Why watch a static company logo or black screen for 30 seconds? Even when you claim something, ads comes out. I understand the need for ads, however ads should be 10 seconds at most. Too much time wasted on ads cannot really enjoy the game. Will rate again if improved.']",com.frismos.dogworld,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frismos.dogworld&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-22 22:01:04.685375,us,en,com.frismos.dogworld

year and have really enjoyed it. Recently though, the events are just reskins of either floors from Cat Game or repeats of already past events. While a little repeat is to be expected, it just seems like they stopped caring about working on this game. Getting to the point where I am done with the regular tower and there are no options to continue, unless I spend actual money. Getting a little disappointed, because it is a fun game most times.', ""Great game! I really love it and I enjoy it. I think it runs smoothy and it's really fun to collect dogs. I do have one thing that bothers me. Recently I've been having to uninstall and reinstall the game because it keeps glitching. Whenever I load the game up and I'm waiting in the loading screen once it gets to 100% the dog glitches out and then my screen goes black. Nothing happens after that and it's been happening recently. I hope this can get fixed. It's still a great game, love it!"", ""Cute and fun time waster about collecting dogs! I haven't been able to put it down! For such a simple concept it sure is fun. It's a bit money hungry but not overly so. A purchase removes ads, at least. They are generous with premium currency so that's always a plus. It would be nicer if there were more than 2 mini games to earn coins, though. Overall I'm happy with this game. The dogs are super cute, there are a ton of different ones (real and fantasy) and the wait times are not that bad!"", ""The cuteness can't be denied, and I love how every dog has their own unique animation - that makes the collecting all the more worthwhile! My main gripe is that advancing depends heavily on crafting, which takes a good amount of both resources and coins, which are hard to earn with only two mini games. There's a whole lot of waiting involved (wait for boxes to be delivered, wait for food options to be refreshed, wait for crafting to be completed) and the minigames are both pretty short plays."", ""I really love the game but I've recently started having issues with booting the game up. It will load the start screen and once it starts loading, it give me a black screen and I can no longer play it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it a couple of times and it loads my save, vut after a few times of playing, it give me the dreaded black screen again. Not sure who to contact because the black screen won't really allow me to contact anyone. 😕"", ""Recently it's just been glitching out at the loading screen and going black. I've been trying for a week or so now just to get loaded into the game, but it will instead freeze up and sometimes make me restart my phone entirely. It was fun for a bit, I guess, and I like it more than CG because I'm a dog person... but it is quite literally unplayable."", ""This is my updated review! It took a few trys to actually get the game to the point where i had a game id and it would save my progress. The game is addicting but you have to be lucky with the spins in the beginning to actually be able to move on. Its not a problem after you get past the tutorial part but in the beginning if you keep getting dogs then you don't have enough supplies to continue and you have to start over. This needs to be fixed for future players! It is still a pretty fun game!"", ""After continuously getting the black screen when trying to load, I deleted the game then re-installed it. It worked! But now it's doing the same thing AGAIN. I'm missing another event because of these issues, and I did very much enjoy the game. This whole situation, however, is really souring my opinion and enjoyment, ESPECIALLY due to the developers' lack of action and response."", ""I LUV it!!! It's SOOO cute and fun. I very rarely rate 5 starts so be proud of yourself! Very underrated! I don't even get pop up adds! 100% recomend! Update: I'm changing my rating. Its not letting me play anymore. Only thing I can do is click the play button. I can hear the music but after I click the play button it brings me to a black screen and nothing happens. Just the music playes. Pls fix."", ""It's cute but it gets old doing the same two mini games over and over to earn coins. And sometimes when you watch an ad, it completely freezes the game (sometimes my phone too) and then crashes. Also the percentage of landing a dog the further you go is annoying. I want to continue to get more rooms, not collect an over amount of materials."", ""This game is super fun to play casually when you need something to do. The mini games are super user friendly and super helpful when you need some coins. The crafting section is great, but my only complaint is that it takes a while to get a dog in any room, and my barbecue room has a huge amount of cotton before there's even a chance you can get a dog. Other than that, not disappointed!☺️"", ""The game is cute. Its just as fun as cat collector, which I've played for almost 3 years now. But this one has too any ads! After each round of game play there is an ad before you get your coins. Ger rid of that please! There is a glitch in the doggopedia, I can't see most of my dogs, and when I scroll through it, it doesn't work correctly. Each time I deliver a basket or feed for supplies, instead of going back where I was, I'm taken to the top of the tower. It's just frustrating."", ""Crafting recipes are so difficult. Would definitely like to see them be changed to be like Cat Game's recipes. An option to permanently opt out of global chat (CG got this recently) would be amazing. I think the % chance of getting a dog is a lie, feels like I have to wait and spin so many times before I get one. I love this game, I'm enjoying it even more than CG (that I've played for 2+ years and am almost max level on). With a few tweaks, I think it'll be perfect!"", ""This game has been a lot of fun so far. The dogs are super cute and my 4yr old daughter absolutely loves them all. Problem now is that the game was asking me to update, but it hasn't 😕 had the spinning circle the entire day. Tried resetting my phone, nothing. Tried turning it off then back on, nothing. I even tried Uninstalling to see if that would work but now it won't even let me re-install! 🥺 Please help fix this bug!"", ""Amazing game! I love the designs and animations, foods are cute. I love every dog and I'm attached to all of them! I just hate the fact that you have to wait for a very very long time because then I either have to do random stuff for the long time on the game or just leave and go back later which annoys me a bit. Good game overall though"", 'i loved cat game so much even though i\'m a dog person so obviously i\'m super into dog game! it really is the best. (1.) it\'s calming without being boring. (2.) you never run out of things to do, but there\'s no stressful feeling of like ""ugh it\'s too much work."" (3.) there\'s mini games! and the adorable dog home decor challenges? ugh yes, so fun! (4.) the mini games are actually fun and you get coins for playing them. i\'d love a unicorn version in the future!', ""Recently been having issues with the game loading, I get a blank screen with music playing. I've tried on two separate phones and tried re-downloading it. When it does finally load it works for a few minutes and then crashes. Seems to be an issue for a lot of people right now, so hoping it can be fixed soon."", ""I really liked it to start. Got all the way to level 23 and suddenly got stuck on a black screen. I uninstalled and reinstalled and had to start all over. Support says they can't help me because the game added random numbers to the end of my screenname and I don't know them. Started all over and now it's stuck on the black screen again when I try to open it. I think I'm done."", ""Very annoying. After waiting for a few months for it to catch onto some of CG's better qualities and not just compile its worst the game only presented a black screen every time I attempted to log into it. For two days, everytime I tried to get into the heart of the app this happened. Since I know the first thing is always suggested to Uninstaller and reinstall, I did that and the game started me over and says backup and restoring can't be done. What a waste."", 'Definitely a super fun game. Crafting is a little harder than Cat Game but still really fun. Great support too. They just restored both of my accounts after having to get a new phone and not being able to get back into my old Google Play account. The only thing I wish they would allow is for us to be able to gift more than 10 items at a time to club members requesting items.', ""Was looking for a cute collection game with a very specific want for a clean colorful style, and this + cat game fits the bill very well. I like to support games I'm fond of so I've allowed myself to purchase ONE floor from each, and otherwise haven't felt compelled to purchase anything at all to proceed. I do wish there were more mini games I admit, a simple endless runner I believe would go over really well, but all in all a lot of fun, can't complain!"", ""I wrote this review on the cat alternative so I figured I'd mention it here too. It's an amazing game but there are some wifi troubles. It could just be me but for both games I have to frequently switch my wifi on and off because you need wifi to play but the game won't load when it's on. Sometimes you need wifi to do things and sometimes you can play offline perfectly fine which is weird. Other than that it's sooo adorable and I highly recommend it!!"", ""This app won't work properly for me. I downloaded it, chose my starter dog, then it went to the house and the only thing it showed was the floor and the dog I chose. No tutorial. I thought it was just like that and I've played the cat game, so I fed her and even got two decos as well as the next dog. But I ran out of food and nothing. I couldn't do anything. So I closed the app and got back in and it restarted. From the beginning where you choose the dog."", ""I've played dg for 2 yrs and cg for 1 yr. Lately cg has become unplayable due to lag. I worry the same will happen here after having invested thousands of hrs and $. Dog Game lacks some features from Cat Game & the crafting + leveling is overall more difficult. It lacks a full VIP reward system as well. My biggest issue is with player support. Often we feel ignored with our feedback & concerns. We know we won't get help from certain support staff. Bugs are left unfixed & there is no compensation"", 'Really great game with awesome drawings. The one thing that I would complain about is the ads; right after you play a mini game,it just gives you a pop-up ad. I believe this is similar to the cat game, so if you are interested in the game, this game will surely spark your interest.', ""its awsome! i love it so cute the one thing that bothers me is when you get a puppy it comes in a basket and when you get to a higher level it take soo long to get out of the basket but it isn't to big of a problem so i still give it five stars its a very fun game so i recomend it its very cute i play it so much"", ""I really love the game:) 1. No issues 2 . No laggy stuff 3. Not a lot of ads 4.Really fun and colorful 5.a lot of reskins from cat game but I don't mind"", ""the game doesn't work. it makes me restart the game every time and it doesn't show anything but the dogs. no tutorial or menu. nothing."", 'I love this game, from the art to the gameplay its highly addictive. I do suggest it to everyone, as a dog lover i love every piece of it! To the devs thank you so much for making it. Have a nice day', ""This game is sooo cute!! I definitely recommend it. It does have very few ads, but it can take a really long time to get a basket. Otherwise, It's very fun!"", ""Very cute game. I love this game and CG, but I play this more since I'm more of a dog person than a cat person. The only real issue I have with it is that sometimes the loading gets stuck at around 55%, and I have to restart the app to get back to the home screen. The premium keys aren't very easy to get as the only way is through completing floors, and it would be great if you could add the ability to add friends and private messages!"", ""I enjoy this game a lot, super cute and fun to play, I love the different themes :) Edit: As I level up, the chances are becoming too low, and collecting is difficult. I'm only level 15 - hope to see some tweaks in this area as the game has so much potential!"", ""It's basically the cat game, but with dogs! I've loved the cat game since my friend introduced me to it a few years ago, and when my sibling brought this to my attention I couldn't pass up the opportunity to play. Aside from minor stylistic changes it's the same; so it's perfect to play when I'm waiting on things to craft in the cat game (and vice versa) While it seems a little odd to have the same themes as paid for floors in the cat game be free in this one, that's really the only flaw imo"", ""Also having the black screen after the loading as others are reporting. A little disappointed that it's right in the middle of an event and more disappointed now that I may get auto-booted from my club before this gets fixed. I'm really trying to hang in there because I enjoy Cat Game so much, but it's getting very difficult."", ""An inferior version of Cat Game, which is a shame cause I really love the cute dogs as well. Crafting is such a nightmare though - both regular and events. It's not nearly as much of a slog to get through levels twice as high up as the ones in my little dog tower. Feels like they want you to spend money to move faster but nah. I'd get more for my money from their own other product."", ""Changed my rating. We had to get to like the 4th floor before we were able to quit the game and have it save. My son and I both downloaded this. Played it a bunch. I got to the second level with 2 dogs when I stopped playing. Next time I went into the game, all my progress was gone except the original dog that I picked. The same thing happened with my son. I love the cat game and had high hopes for this one. If you fix the bug, I'll gladly change my rating."", ""Hi! I've been playing dog game for a few months now, but suddenly the app started closing on me and now after the loading screen it goes dark and won't open the game. I've Uninstalled it and reinstalled it, it connected to my account, and again the same problem. I'd contact support, but if I can't open the app I'm not sure how to contact support. Any idea why this is happening or how I can fix it? Thanks in advanced!"", ""Ever since the update I can't play the game. I LOVED playing it. The update has caused the game to no load. The start screen comes up, press the start button, says its loading to 55% then it just goes black and nothing else happens. I'm super upset because I love playing the game but now I'm also missing out on the events that are going on. Really hoping this gets fixed fast."", 'I play ""Cat Game"" as well this game is just as cute and is easy to play, however it\'s not as convenient as ""Cat Game"". I don\'t like the way hearts cannot be collected in one tap and expire too quickly. It takes up too much space on the club screen and messes with our club\'s ability to chat.', ""900 dogs and no Index to keep track! ...... I started to play the game and it seemed okay .... Then, upon getting my first 'epic' dog I went to look for it but couldn't find it. I then realized that ALL dogs appear as the same level once opened. I searched for some type of index to differentiate the dogs but nothing. I informed the support team and they said there was no such option in the game. Absolute fail.""]",com.minogames.dogs.android,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minogames.dogs.android&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-22 22:01:13.080384,us,en,com.minogames.dogs.android

the switch, found this which is actually done by the same people. Not disappointed at all, still has the origins of Nintendogs which I have missed. Need to add the ability to Bath your dog and give them treats though! Overall cute larl game, definitely wanting it on the switch too.', ""As this is a newer kind of version of Nintendogs, I don't understand the point. You must pay for your own dog if it isn't a German Shepherd, and you can't change the fur color unless you pay to do so. May I add, you can't be under the age of twelve to make purchases. It wasn't my childhood, (I'm a Gen Z,) but I'm pretty sure the entire premise of Nintendogs was to choose your own pooch to make fun memories with."", 'This game is amazing!!!! 5 stars. Maybe in the future we can give our dogs a bath, treats and have a few more rooms, but otherwise this game is amazing!! Definitely the best dog care game. Cute graphics, clothes and furniture. I give this game 5 stars and hope everyone gives it a try. I absolutely love this game and recommend it to anyone looking for a nice dog game. Hopefully there will be lots of cool updates!!! Great work on this amazing game!!!', ""Some Reasons I Gave This Game a 3 : 1. You cannot have play with a bunch of dogs in the same room only just one.. 2. Lots of the things in the shop are very expensive in my opinion... 3. It's also unfair for me because only the German Shepherd and the Toy Poodle are free but some of their colour tones you can have with Real Money... Soooooo those are my reasons, I know that they're a bit arrogant and shows the game's flaws but I think it's better to be honest even if the truth hurts!"", ""This game is forcing, I can hardly do what I want and at the start it says 'choose your first pet' or something along the lines, and you literally only have the option of a boring blonde thing. You get to choose the colours as black and white but you still end up with a boring blonde thing. Disappointing really."", 'I have the cat version too and absolutely adore both games. The creators anf developers really did a wonderful job. Iv looked for years and years for a Nintendogs type game and am so happy its finally here. Thankyou so much guys. Please can you add more dog breeds one day. This game is 10/10', ""The graphics are good but everything else is a bust. Money money money. All this game cares about. You have to pay REAL MONEY just for your dog to learn ONE TRICK!! Like come on not cool. And in the begging it says to pick your dog, but it doesnt even let ME choose the dog. If I could give 0 stars, i would. But I can't. Heart broken this game is a pay to play thought I found a good game."", ""This is an amazing game with lots of features!!!! I think towards the future this game could have maybe a few more dog breeds as well as more rooms, a bath feature, being able to give your dog a treat and maybe more personalitys for the puppys!!!!!! Other than that this it deserves 5 stars in my opinion and it's a great quality dog game simulation!! :D"", 'I almost never leave low reviews. If I dislike a game I just move on. However, anyone thinking of playing this game should know that you will install the game, be forced to wait for another 400mb installation once you load the game, enter your birthdate, and then after all that the game randomly selects which pet you need to spend your time with. The others are locked behind a paywall. Isnt the point of the game to offer power of choice with a pet that fits your likes? I mean... just no.', ""It's such a cute game, pretty similar to nintendogs. But that's why I love it! But i wish you you guys could add bubble baths for the dogs, bc it's more fun to wash them then brush. I also kinda want you guys to add treats, when a dog behaves u can give it a treat or when it does tricks :D"", ""Perfect for kids and nostalgic adults who grew up with Nintendogs. Has the most fair monetization I've seen in a free game (few ads. No cryptocurrency, prices are in dollars. Things like tricks that are paywalled are not necessary to enjoy gameplay, and prices are cheap) so parents can feel safe letting their kids play. Gameplay is Nintendogs lite. Not a lot of content, but very good at scratching that itch for a loving pet. First dog is random, but you can reset app until you get one you like"", 'This is a good game, graphics are good, dogs are adorable, my one suggestion is that you add more dogs like Pomeranian, Great Dane, husky, but overall this game is fantastic 😊', 'Can you add more things to do? I cant get my lab friendship lvl past 11. I wish there was a online option also. I love this game but I just wish there was more to do and more breeds and colors.', 'Its okay, i love the graphic buy i wish everything didnt cost actual money, also i wish i could take them out on walks, interact with other dog/people etc.', ""Great game high quality good graphics and good graphics and it's fun to play with the dogs but also make it so you don't have to use your voice for tricks also for all you saying they stole Little Friends: Dogs & Cats it is actually by the same people so they didnt steal it they just upgraded it and put it on mobile"", 'I wanted to try it out because it looks like the same game as the popular Little Friends game for switch. Would have been nice if I could actually play though. Downloaded the content but the app would never start. Kept kicking me out. Really unfortunate.', ""The shibas are so cute! But unfortunately every dog except for the toy poodle cost 5$ each (per color) it's clear that effort went into this game so I won't give 1 star but I believe that the page is misleading, advertising all the dogs you won't get. also this is a blatant Nintendogs ripoff"", 'Save your time, game crashes on startup every single time. Not optimized well at all. I have a Google pixel 6 so nothing wrong on my end, again, save your time.', ""It's a nice game although it says that there are 190 different breeds in the description. There only appears to be 8 and there's constant paywalls to unlock the dogs very misleading"", ""Also, first things first, I have this game on Switch too, BUT why the Switch version don't has the day night systhem like here?! I was so happy when I saw the same game here but with the Day night systhem! Csn't you update it to the switch version too? The graphics are OK I love it how it is. Sadly Is you have to pay for other dogs and colours but ok. At the end the games remember me here more to Nintendogs instead of the Switch cuz the day night systhem is missing.."", ""It's a really cute game.... But it keeps lagging, When I try to purchase something it crashes. Please fix the issue. Thanks"", ""Oh my god, finally a true successor to Nintendogs. I can't even tell you how badly I've been wanting something exactly like this on mobile. Just. Oh man this is fabulous. Thanks, devs!"", ""I like the it's simple and easy to interact with. I hope there's more breeds and more activities to play with. So far it's nice game and I'm looking forward for the updates of the game. 😊🤩"", ""Too bad they no longer update the game and haven't since 2022 😩 need more breeds and events, need more to do. It's a great game tho, reminds me of nintendogs haha 😅 runs very well on phone 🙏🏻"", 'This app is very glitchy and has a lot of downloading at the beginning that takes forever to download.', 'Love the game but wished there was more stuff you could do with your fury friend. Like different compitions, with on walks meet other players.', ""This i a good game can you just change it to where we can pick which dog we want because it picked out a dog for me that I didn't want and I can't change it."", ""Trash tried atleast 19 times to boot it up but didn't let me play and just kicked me out I want to play my childhood game so fix it"", ""I like it, but why the only option is a bull dog and the colour is only black and white, it's a good game tho, but u need to fix the problem there."", 'Cool, i just play today, and i love it. It just like nintendogs 😍 please add more free items 😄 thanks 🙏🏼😁', ""please update according to the sound of the dog and the breed, don't all sound the same....please also update so that the dog can grow bigger and add other features"", 'This game is so fun and if you you have a dog that has to play this game can make you remind. I definitely 5 star.', ""I love this game it is apsaloutlty amazing 💙💙💙💙💙💙💫💫💫💫💫💫 wanted to put happy dog with hot dog gif but it wouldn't let me. I am now into marvel guardians of the galaxy so I wanted a dog named after my favorite character Nebula and I got a black and white shiba inu. I also wanted one named after Nebula's sister Gamora so I got a black and tan German shepherd. They both match the personality of the characters that they are named after 😀😀😀💫💫💫💙💙💙🐕🐕🐕 Best game ever. Thank you."", 'The closest you can get to a Nintendogs experience. I love it.', 'It a very cute game but the controls for walking the dog are very unstable.', 'Download assets and... Shut down. Restart, still downloading assets and... Shut down again ! If your app is broken, just delete it from the store 🙄', 'Do you know that you just ruined a pretty good game? These people literally ripped off little friends on the Nintendo Switch. At least give credit if your gonna steal a game. Seriously guys. Just get a Nintendo Switch to play the real Little Friends and not some weird rip off mobile game.', 'Free to play most of the way through. You unlock other dogs by taking care of your first.', ""Seems like a nice game so I got it but after it randomizes your dog breed it ask you to pick a name but than doesn't let you type."", 'Cute dog, only one problem, sometimes the dog will be invisible, nice game actually']",jp.co.neilo.withmydog,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.neilo.withmydog&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-22 22:01:14.511460,us,en,jp.co.neilo.withmydog

being a mobile game. Though it deffinitly has room to improve! 1. I couldn't name my dogs to adopt (this is my biggest problem) 2. The end activity button was too low on the screen making it hard to press. Positive 1. Fairly good tutoria, I wish there was an option to skip it for those who just don't like tutorials (so me lol) 2. The dogs are adorable, and the movement is fairly good. I do wish the select/grab button was on a different side than the joystick"", ""This game is a good game, but there's things that make it hard to play and that need improvement. 1. The dogs can get stuck far too easily, and you can't get them unstuck without going to the next day. 2. If you give your dogs food then leave the app because, let's say a dog got stuck, and then come back, the food you gave them is gone but you have to redo the tasks, which I personally don't like. It's a good game, just needs a lot of improvements."", ""This game is great! It doesn't have much in app purchases unlike some others I played and the only in app purchases are for gems you can earn for free! Everything else is free too! It's really fun and not that grindy! I love playing this game, it's even offline! Great game for people who don't alannah spend money on a game and is just looking for something to cure boredom :)"", ""This app is fun but there are some is I have 1. I cannot name my dog so the people don't know what the dog's name is 2. The dogs go through the doors which makes them very hard to catch 3. The dogs are so fast and I having issues putting them in and out of their cages 4. It's unusual to let dogs go around without permission and 5. I have a little a bit of issues because the cages only are two so I can't get more dogs if you guys fix it I will be happy to play it"", ""This game isn't too bad. The joystick is a little weird, also if I accidentally click off naming for the dog, I can't name them. Lastly, the camera. Please fix it. You can't take pictures or get off the camera if you click on it. Please fix these and I will re download."", ""So I love the idea of this game but here's the issue first of all it's very confusing if I don't know how to do something I can't get help or skill that part! For example one of the dogs needed to go to the clinic so I took it there it said that it needed inspection so I gave it inspection and it didn't let me go farther than that every time I did the inspection it either said quick inspection and so I would but it wouldn't let me treat it. Plz help!!!"", ""Absolutely fantastic game ever I can't stop playing it also I was thinking of things you should add when dogs are getting a bath could you add shampoo or a dog cap for his ears that would be adorable otherwise Please keep the game the same as it is if anyone is ready this please install this game it's absolutely amazing also they game has my dog in it :) amazing game 5 stars👍"", 'this is a great game! totally love this, but it gets boring when you play for some time :< but I still recommend the game for some pet lovers out there :>.

nice game, overall. Its got adorable graphics, and the tutorial is mostly understandable. It even teaches you a little about what dogs can and cannot eat ^.^ The gems can be hard, but are not impossible to get. Although, its hard to get a large sum without watching a lot of ads ~w~ Other than that, there isnt much to do. The 'walk' can get a little repetative, and I would like other things to do. Theres room for improvement, but its a nice game =3 a keeper for me"", ""This is one of the few games I can play without turning my wifi and data off due to ads. The few ads there are don't interrupt gameplay or make noise. The art style and little animations are very cute. There's an option to buy stars but it's still possible to get them in game (At least a hundred every day) and everything else can be earned in-game as well."", ""This app is amazing - 11/10 would recommend. It's great; engaging and cute, with an amazing, simple, and easy to understand system that doesn't have the overbearing complexity that certain games do. It's great and relaxing, you get enough rewards and new things to really feel that you're accomplishing things, and it's fun - a rare but great find. Also, I love the way that you get gems, but the only thing I wish is that there was a way you could get more, even after you've watched the ads"", ""I have had this game on every device for years because you can play it offline. My no1 major issue is it forces you to replay the same 10 stages or so over and over again to grind for money so you can power up to move forward. Otherwise you'll eventually be forced to stop by an enemy you could not possibly defeat despite a perfect score on everything else. Wish there was an endless mode that didn't kick you from the game unless you messed up too many times."", 'This game is actually really helpful if you have ADHD and need to listen to informational videos or lectures but need to do something with your hands+visual stimulation as to not get bored or overwhelmed. Its just in depth enough where I can focus on what people are saying without thinking too hard about actions in game that I get distracted. Extremely useful for me personally!', ""The ads don't interrupt gameplay, it's really fun and easy to learn how to play, and progress is at your own pace. I loved this game-- I first played it years ago, and got it again a few months ago for nostalgia. The new Halloween update annoys me, though. It's extremely buggy and made it nearly impossible to perform lucky hits."", 'this is a good game to play when your bored and need to pass the time! its a bonus that the chararacters and art style are adorable! there are a few things that i would like to suggest though. like a easier way to get rainbow stars and making the game have consistency of the controls actually working after a hour or so of playing. overall, the game is very fun and very adorable! ^^', ""It's a very cute and fun game to play :). I love how we learn about how to treat real life dogs with the album descriptions, and I'd love to see more of that. The artstyle is very cute and the dogs are adorable! The gameplay is very fun and very chill, and I love the fusion feature. It'd be cool if we could get other dogs more easily, as well as a bigger variety of dogs. After you unlock Lack and reach level 100 with him there's not much left to do other than getting more stars to get more dogs."", ""I've known this game for years, after I changed my phone four times. This is the cute and best game at that time, which can I finish after some time and now I've decided to re-install and start all over again. Though, I wish the dev could add more things and keep updating the game so I can enjoy it a little longer after finishing the main story."", ""Could be improved, game speed is too fast to start with. The tips flash across the screen and nowhere else to read them. Instructions are too quick, no way to pause the instructions... Some features don't work right yet. But good idea, just needs some work. Very cute style."", 'A very simple but charming game! The dogs are adorable, and the gameplay, although very straightforward, is entertaining! I found myself completely in love with this game the second I opened it. No in your face ads, glitchy controls, or pixelated graphics. The art is adorable and the story is a little cherry on top of this amazing game.', ""I love the art, and story. Its fun to discover new achievements, and just play in general. There is little to no ads which is a huge plus in my opinion and a really good time saver. So in all I would definately recommend this cute app to anyone who's looking for an easy easy way to kill time."", 'I like that the microtransactions are not as obnoxious as in other games. The in game currency is earned easily and quickly, watching ads is afaik entirely optional, but you earn currency by doing so. The transitions between power levels are smooth and earning gold for upgrades only turns more intense in later levels (ca. At 350 or so), but feels entirely appropriate.The graphics are adorable and the achievements (gold stars) are nicely integrated and unlock environmental interactions', ""GReaT game! so cute and simple, great music, sounds and visuals. SO, CUte, great variation in dogs interactions and reactions! and i couldn't help but notice the great (i forgot word. as below)! it keeps from getting boring and monotinous by the varition in like everything, game speed, (great strategic introduction of lack). 6 stars for above and beyond! (ps. would like for there to be a toggle off for the red 'lucky' thing.?)"", ""So adorable and addicting. 😍 Although I think it would be nice if it had more to the game than just feeding the dogs. Like maybe a neighborhood or something that you can walk around and collect and gain coins from feeding other people's dogs and playing fetch with the dogs or something. Just add something new, it might even be more addicting and adorable!!"", ""its one of the best games on my phone! super duper cute! its really a satisfying sound when the ghosts get hit. but there is one thing that kind of bugs me but only one thing I swear. why can't you get the rainbow star gems easier? I mean my poor puppy hasn't been able to level up forever! but I'm cool with that. oh and love the cool features like the comic strips and walking the dog!"", ""The game become very addictive when you get the hang of it, the art style is very cute.

But when you fully complete the game, it become boring and you're stuck in a loop where you just hit the bomb and eat the foods forever."", ""To put it simply, BEST. GAME. EVER. Oh, where to start? It has dogs and puppies, it's VERY addicting and a great time killer when people like myself who don't have many things to do throughout the day can enjoyably play on their phone, it's graphics are great and simple, not to mention cute, the levels are still challenging even at level 200 and beyond (Like I said, I have a lot of free time and my only hobby is playing video games.) And even BEYOND what I just said, it's kept me coming back. :)"", ""I like this game, although I have a few issues with it. The upgrades get so expensive and pretty annoying. It's honestly a pain getting the rainbow stars to afford anything. I don't wanna spend an hour watching 25 ads for some of 'em, idk about you. I don't understand how to get the yellow stars either tbh. I wish there was some background on what the things you're fighting are, like why do they like dog food? And it has kind of bad wording at the start too. Other than that, it's pretty good."", ""Really cute and lovely, a fun and addicting game! The only problem is that it gets boring over time if you are done with all story parts with both dogs and have all the puppies; there's nothing to achieve anymore. Being able to unlock more dogs to play with would be amazing."", ""Very fun and enjoyable game. Whenever i need to add new apps to my phone this is one of my first ideas. It's educational teaching you about what figs and cats can and cannot eat. And the gameplay mechanics are simple but can become very challenging. All and all a great game."", ""A very cute game, if you like dogs this is the game for you! The only reason I gave it a 4/5 stars is because you can't watch as many ads as you wish for, you can only watch a certain amount a day, and because you can get thigs out of ghe ads its very frustrating, at list for me."", ""It's adorable and time consuming. The graphics are so cute and so is the music. The story, along with the concept, is so unique and portrayed in such simply effective ways. Completely recommend for people who have an appreciation for wacky and cute stories."", ""It's a good game but what's the most annoying part about it is the hitboxes are wonky and it has a strange delayed lag to it which makes you have to tap the projectiles twice or they just completely ignore the fact you tapped them and end your game immediately. This has happened to me too many times and takes away from the relaxing cute aspect of the game."", ""The game is actually a great time-killer. It's pretty straightforward, and you don't necessarily have to do purchases to win. I don't enjoy binging ads to get crystals, but at least they're not invasive of the gamespace. Overall, enjoyable experience."", ""Adorable, some of the stuff is vague (I imagine it's just the language barrier) but it's easy to figure out. The rewards are fair and not near- impossible to obtain. A great, cute little game to play to pass the time."", ""I loved this game so much!! I love the style, storyline, dogs, and pretty much everything about it! I did see some questions, though. The Touch Evade can be accomplished by tapping the dog repeatedly during walks (outside of levels). Although I love the game, it struck me as odd that you can't really seem to level up the puppies without milk. :)"", ""Its a really cute addictive game to play! Playing as two different dogs, both are extremely cute and have their own things to swipe at enemies. I'd highly recommend this game since its quick and easy to get behind, and fun to play to pass the time!"", 'I remember playing this game when I was younger, it was and still is a lot of fun! The art style is adorable and the ""album"" is just the funniest. My only problem is that I\'ve noticed a few glitches when you go to ""walk with the dog."" Like with the red ball in the tree, it disappears halfway through the animation.', ""Very simple but very cute game. If you're looking for something mechanically deep you'll have to look elsewhere but if you want a game with adorable visuals that you can play for a couple minutes without it demanding you give up months of your life, this is a great pick."", ""Not too many ads, clean, silly, good graphics, honestly there isn't much to say. It's simple, and yet it never gets boring. Broken language from here and there, but it's translated. Totally reccomend :)"", ""It's a super cute little game with a repetitive yet good feeling mini game at it's core. I especially enjoy the art style and collection of events that can be occurred and catalouged. It also has no ads that directly stop your game and the placement of the sidebar ads have yet to be cumbersome"", ""Very fun game! I have played it on and off for the past 4ish years and am still not bored everytime I return. It weirdly isn't syncing up my achievements with my google play thing, but that might be an issue on my end. Over all I really appreciate the little snip bits of why the bad foods are bad for dogs. I think that's clever to add."", ""Such a cute and adorable game. All of the dogs are cute and so are the animations. It's really smooth. One complaint I have is its too easy to collect coins. Another is it's too hard to collect stars. Stars let's you buy goodies like milk for puppies and more puppies. There's only two ways to collect stars: ads and walk the dog. Walk the dog is cute, but you barely get stars from it. I wish you could do more with it. Other than that, its a awesome game. So addicting."", ""Very cute! I played this game like crazy a few years ago and went to revisit it, but I can't find an option to restore my progress. I made it really far and had a few different dogs, so I'm wondering if there might be a way to restore what I had? If not I'd be cool with just replaying, but if possible I'd love to get that back."", 'Really fun and cute, the graphics are simple and the gameplay itself is easy to understand. Also has interesting facts about dogs. Also the ads are not shown during actual gameplay only in the house or walking the dog.', ""it's a really adorable and fun app. The animals are so cute and the game is really addicting! The only thing I would say is that you can only watch so many ads to get stars before it cuts you off for the day, and I don't think it's very necessary. It's not easy to get stars unless you watch the ads. But other than that, great app!"", ""A really lovely game. It's a simple time waster with a cute and well tied together aesthetic. The main gimmick is tapping the screen to bat away bad foods while letting the dog eat the good foods. The banner ads don't interfere with game play and ads can be watched for paid currency. You can get around $4 worth of currency per day through that and check in rewards without spending any money. Main negatives are poor English translations and a lack of explanations for other game mechanics."", ""very cute! the game ain't hard to understand even if you miss what the tips says or notes that pop up, Which I do find they go away to fast for me to read but if it was big issue it's always a easy fix. The game style is adorable of corse. I like it and it's great!"", ""This is quite possibly one of the best (and cutest) games on the play store. After playing 400+ stages in only 5 days I can confirm that this game is just as addictive as it is cute. Although this game is originally in a different language the translation is well done and you barely see any ads. Even the premium currency is easy to get without spending a penny. I can't say anything bad about this game. l just wish there was a little more story. I can't wait to see more from the developers!""]",com.QSSUMSTUDIO.FeeDog,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.QSSUMSTUDIO.FeeDog&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-22 22:01:21.715003,us,en,com.QSSUMSTUDIO.FeeDog

figuring out what to do and what the purpose is of having the dogs run laps in circles... keep thinking they\'re going to get tired and get thirsty... thought it was going to be more like a ""real merge three"" game, not merge two or more. I do however enjoy ""creating"" the new dog species! it is original, but it needs improvements overall. gets repetitive and lacks incentive after awhile. but I think many people would like it with a clear explanation of what it is', ""Alright, so, I really enjoyed this game at first. It was super fun, really cute, definitely addictive. However... I'm about halfway through the catalogue both for the grass track and the snow track, and now it's boring. It takes too long to get to the bigger dogs, since you only get two hours of away time. There's an upgrade for two more but... Do I wanna pay to still barely be able to buy two dogs at a higher tier? There just isn't enough to do to keep it fun. Good for a while tho!"", 'This is a good mindless game to pass the time, it helped me fall asleep. A tutorial would have been nice, I played for days before I figured it to click on the dogs and rabbits. The look of the pit bull was disappointing. All the dogs are very happy looking except him. The devs had an opportunity to put the beautiful dogs in a positive light and they took a wrong turn with it. Last, I beat both levels in just over a week, more levels would be awesome. I am uninstalling for now.', ""Addicting and fun, until the ads stopped working, except, of course, the ads that provide zero benefits, which also happen extremely often now. I tried restarting the app multiple times. No luck. Fix this soon or I will delete. I already had to skip a bunch of rewards that I can't get anymore because I could have gotten them by watching an ad. Not satisfied at all... :( UPDATE: They sort of fixed the issue. I can get a reward from a video once, then I need to restart the app, so 3 from 2 stars."", 'The design of everything is very simple and cute. The animations and feel of it is very happy. You do have to wait, but the animations help for the wait time since the animation entertains you as you wait. A very fun game overall. Perfect for people who like achievin', ""This game was fun at first but it starts playing you when your about the finish the game like not giving you your money and taking your good dogs and replacing them with bad ones ( for example there are 5 pages and I was on the husky on the 4th page and they replaced it with a dog from the fourth page) which may not seem like a big deal but the higher the dog the more epband money so replacing it so you get less and have to wait months for a new dog This game is just impractical don't waste time"", ""Starts off fun but after you gather a few dog species it becomes very difficult to move in to the next species. especially because the money you gather while the app is off is limited. Fun but has more potential. I've dropped it now."", 'Very addictive. As a dog person this game is perfect for me. If you are a dog person you should download Merge Dogs! The graphics are great. So many new types of dogs to collect. I have used the 2x speed. It is one of the best money makers in the game. The 5 star review has been earned. Download right now!', ""Really good game it gets kind of boring because it's just a loop you get a dog you merge the dog then again. I think it's a very good game though."", ""I love everything but could get lil boring rarely adds don't have to pay money it's good 😊 one thing though there is bugs like sometimes one of the dogs was tiny and hard to see maybe see what's wrong? I recommend the game though ;)"", ""This game is amazing! There are rarely ads, and the dogs are super cute! The only thing is that it gets boring sometimes but that's okay! PLEASE download this app!!!"", ""This game started out lots of fun and I was always excited to see all the new dogs you could unlock but as you get into the later stages, sometimes my best dogs are randomly deleted and replaced, I have been playing for a long while so it takes weeks and months to get a new dog but they keep getting replaced before I can get a new dog, it does it often and it's impossible to progress through the game at this point. It takes away from the cute aspects. Example; Lost my Samoyed for a Dalmatian."", 'okay. i love the colours and the art style used! they really compliment each other and make the game enjoyable. i REALLY like the ability to buy certain dogs as you level up!! that makes it a lot easier but still challenging enough to keep playing! one thing i would like would be the ability to purchase outfits for certain dogs, with in game watch to earn ads, and ingame cash from the dogs. overall this game is great ✌️', 'This game is great! So fun! When i downloaded it at first i was a bit skeptical thinking about how hard it would be to get more dogs when i got pretty far in the game but i actually enjoy the way they set it up greatly! How you let the dogs run to collect more coins. Its creative and a good way to not run out as well as you dont have to buy coins or watch ads for them! 😁 Love the game! Addicting, easy, and loads of fun!', ""The game isn't really challenging for the mind. Buy a dog, for ever increasing prices, or wait for a free one. Let it run on the track to make money. Combine two of same to get another dog, of a higher level. That one will get you the same income as the two old dogs, only faster, so merging dogs is usually worth it. The rest (free dogs, 20% discount, double speed) is click bait, you get something and the designers earn money. But in the ent, it's surprisingly funny and addictive. I quite like it."", 'I love this game the only thing I wish they could improve is how long you have to merge the dogs. Anyways the whole rest of the game is great!😊', 'This game is amazing and I love it. I stayed up late playing this game!! It is awesome!! I recommend it to whoever is looking at this. If you like offline games... This is for you! All you have to do to get rid of the ads is turn off your mobile data (if you have that) or turn off your interet! Then no ads. It does load, but dont worry. This is a 5 star rating!!! Love it so much. Again you can always get rid of the ads by turning off internet or mobile data. Anyway, thats my review! 🥰🐶🐕🐕\u200d🦺', 'MAGNIFIC DOG MERGE GAME 🐕 good work. Thank you! 🐩 I was about to finish the game, so I uninstall it to restart it, so much it is relaxing and awesome . 💕', ""This game was fun but you need to add a tutorial for new player's but it does help me fall asleep."", ""its a cute game, and the dogs models are adorable. it has a short, simple tutorial which is nice. I just don't like how long it takes to upgrade to the next dog. it's a slow-paced game compared to most idle games but that's not a horrible thing. the in-game purchases are also a bit overpriced. I love it as a time passer, but I'm uninstalling."", ""It's a cute game but it just feels so plain and basic. At least in Merge Planes you could get boosters, etc for the track, and there was a leader board. I don't want to watch fifty million ads just to make my dogs go faster, etc. And they don't even go that fast with the ads. Plus, the ads don't always work. You need to do more to this otherwise boring game."", ""It's a cute app, but is it fun? sort of, at your lowest stage it's fun and you merge but soon it becomes into a log on, collect reward, buy more dogs, close app, repeat. I do like that the ads aren't forced but I do watch them anyway. 1 video to double my 2 billion? sure why not. most people won't like this but I do like grind fest games. so it's cute and it's grindy, following the popular trend of merge apps. with not anything else thrown in to spice it up, that's about it."", ""The cutest game I've played so far. The game is very simple and really good for destressing. Animation is cute, and I get excited every time I get a new dog. I'm unable to play ads though so I can't redeem other features. But overall the game is just really chill and enjoyable."", 'This is a great game. But I have a problem, my progress keeps getting lost! I was at the level were I unlocked the sheltie but I come back the next day and it is gone, i still unlocked it in the book of dogs but did not have it on the track. I probably wont get a reply or a bot reply I just hope that this problem gets fixed.', 'I wanted to like this game, but there are a few things that turned me off. First of which was the farther I got in the game, the speed in which the dogs speed around the track literally made me sick. Visually it was disturbing and maybe should come with a warning. The second thing is why is the pitbull the only vicious looking design. All the other breeds look super sweet and friendly. I think the designers are perpetuating an unfair bias.', 'Fun game, but a while ago(long time) i had much progress on the game when it randomly crashed and wouldnt open, this went on for a week until i gave up. When it finally let me play it deleted most of my progress. It is now crashing again and im thinking it will do what it did previously, nice app, but please fix it so it doesnt delete progress, or atleast let us save it somehow.(im on latest version so that cant be why.)', ""This app is so so cute and fun!! But it has a bug that happened to me twice. I don't know how that happened but it was in the snow place that my fastest dog lost two times. So I have to use more money and it's so hard because of slower income because of the bug. And also the away time says I'll get my income for 4 hours when I don't use the app but it's just actually 4 minutes. I was supposed to earn at least a trillion in 4 hours but it just gives me 50 billion. It's a fun game though. = )"", 'Stopped playing it last year because constant crashes made it impossible to play. Felt the urge to play it again and glad to see that the crashes have been fixed! Cute and fun way to pass the time!', ""Thia game is an adorable idle merge game, there's enough factors that go into each dog that give the game more depth than expected, and I love that it has multiple worlds or zones that play at the same time. The only thing I think the game is lacking is a more solid active playing aspect, I'd like to see some kind of minigame alongside the idle aspects, but it's still a complete game that is worth your time."", ""Like the game as a way to kill time. Got to Pom, and it looked like it was floating? Thought nothing of it and continued to play, only to find that when I got a 2nd Pom, they wouldn't merge. Closed the app and restarted - my 2nd Pom is going and the Pom I have has been taken off the track. This has happened twice now."", ""I think that the game was very simple and easy. It was very short thought. You barley got any dogs and most other breeds can be left out. I know it is kinda tricky to find nonpopular breeds of dogs, but I still think it's great. To the game creaters, you should make one with cats and the different breeds also. I think the game was very cute and I enjoyed it."", ""well.. I liked this game, it was fun to merge the lil doggos to get more doggos. BUT. After getting over half the doggos in the regular one and almost completing the snow one, the game continuously crashes. I open it and not even 2 seconds later it crashes. Not enough time for me to do anything. It's super frustrating because I'm just so close to finishing it. I put a lot of effort into this."", ""It's an easy game to pass the time with. But a few too many ads for my liking. It's ok to have ads for bonus things like the 2x speed but i don't like that one automatically plays for 5 seconds when i close the buy-a-dog screen."", 'The music is great👍 and very happy 😊! I love the dogs 🐕 ❤ and they are very cute 😍! the racing is adorable ❤!', ""great game, I'm enjoying unlocking so many great breeds of dogs. the ads are a bit much but I'm not even mad considering you can use it for speeding up money, leveling up to a higher breed when using money, but it randomly comes up when you arent clicking anything that would start an ad and it gets quite annoy when an ad appears for no reason."", 'after a while you can no longer watch ads because the dogs are going so fast, so every time an ad tried to pop up, you have to watch your dogs run behind a loading screen for about 5-10 seconds.. I miss the ""watch an ad to make them go 2x as fast!"" or ""watch an ad to get the next level of dog!"" so yeah, the process is becoming a lot slower but I still love to poke the doggos. its actually quite addicting considering it gets laggy after a while', ""Love it! Super cute and fun! However!!! It doesn't do a good job at conveying some things. Things like the X2 multiplier lasts 2 minutes and 30 seconds. And it doesn't tell you how much your max away is. All it tells you is that you'll get 2 more hours of max away if you pay them real cash money. A bit unnecessarily annoying."", 'I love the game so much it is a cute doggy game I love I how you can get different dogs my favorite so far that I have is my best one the dalmation. I love this game! Update) I would like a ""Save"" feature. I recently uninstalled (For storage and realized ""oh fu-"".) Reinstalled and lost my progress. If you could add a save feature so i can reload my work would be nice, If its already there then ;-;-', ""Got months of playtime out of this. Simple idler with ROCK SOLID design. Art is adorable, control is intuitive, and lots of dogs means it last you a while. A few design elements raise its quality of life as time goes on: The quick-buy button (not real $) for the smallest dog eventually moves up the ladder as you unlock new dogs, so merge chains don't become impossibly long slogs. And you can always tap the dogs on your track for a little extra speed/cash. My new benchmark for merge-style games."", 'A Great Game! So much fun! At first when i downloaded it looked skeptical and confusing thinking about how hard it would be to get more dogs but when i got a bit far in the game, i actually enjoyed the way it was set up.

dog's with conditions that need tracking. Everything that you need from the app is free with ads, but can upgrade to more features for an affordable monthly (2.99) or yearly price (19.99). Love the free included features that allowed me to track feedings. Water, play, walks, accidents, and so much more. Allows me to stick to puppy's schedule more easily, and with the upgrade, you can set reminders and more."", ""Was unable to unlock the subscription after purchase. Had a difficult time getting in touch with developer for help. Ultimately they helped me and got everything working. I've since upgraded my phone and the app is no longer working. Every time I try to log in it sends me an email with a verification code. When I put the verification code in it tells me that the verification code is not valid. The idea of the app is great but it's not worth all the issues you have to deal with just to use it."", ""I bought this app after I wound up with 2 puppies to help keep track of them. It's a little difficult to keep up with them and accurately record everything, but I'm trying. The app is great but there are a few things I would tweak: -New action types: exercise pen, free time -Also wish the data was presented in a better, more useful manner. We have a weird sleep schedule so we have to flip between two days to check the total hours of play and sleep. All in all, it's useful and worth the price 👍"", ""I really like this app. It's the only app I have found that has so many tracking options which is very helpful. That in itself will keep me using this app. The only thing I'd like to see is a more concise way to see the data by activity/day. It's hard to just look at a long list of activities and the progress graph with all the activities shown by color isn't very useful as I'm not so concerned with how many times our pup has done something but would like to quickly see what time she did it."", ""Love this app! It is a very quick way to track accidents, potty break times, eating times, and health markers. It also gives me reminders so I don't forget to feed my pup. I was using an excel sheet before this and manually entering the time was a hassle. It does glitch every now and then for like 1 second when you first open it, but I think that is mainly from trying to load all of your information."", ""Overall, this is a great app that has made it super easy to track our puppy's day-to-day, which has made a big difference for her and us! The only annoying thing about it is that it takes a minute (literally sometimes) to load activities if my husband added something, which can lead to confusion and double logging. Sometimes I even have to restart the app. Really hope that improves because otherwise it's great."", 'Update: The support team contacted me and resolved the issue for me after I posted the review. 5 star. ---original comment---- It was great until I switched to a new phone, pixel 6a, and I could no longer log in and use the subscription features while I am still paying for the sub. All the data I recorded in the app for my puppy is no longer accessible to me. I tried to contact them in the app multiple times and sent an email but got no response yet. I guess I will have to cancel my sub.', 'Reports are a bit useless. Like the weight chart shows a count of how many time you recorded a weight rather than the actual weights. Annual subscription cost of $24 is a bit pricey for what is offered. Maybe a one time fee. Free optio. Is good for like a dozen entries and then you have to pay so hard to get any real feeling of the value especially when using it to track initial potty training. I just resorted to a white board.', ""This is a fantastic app for anyone with a new puppy or pet in general. Very user friendly interface and clean design. Plenty of pet activities to keep track of and once you get enough data the heat map is great for seeing your dog's habits. The full version that allows two users to track the same pet independently is fantastic and well worth the money, worth noting that only one users needs to have the full version for the sharing function to work."", ""Great app so far! Has really helped us keep track of how our pup is doing. Love the ability to add my husband so he can help keep track as well. Not sure if it is user error but the progress timeline calculation for sleep doesn't seem to be correct which is important for me for our little puppy. I will see if resyncing helps. It would be great if in the future there were widget capabilities to quickly add activities from your phone's home screen!"", ""Update: This app was fantastic. However, I recently switched phones and have had trouble accessing the app. I have been trying for several months to get back into my subscription, and the management team has been utterly useless in making this work. I pay $5/month for the features and can't even get a message back to help me login. I was really enjoying everything about this app, but the lack of customer service from a team I'm paying $5/mo is horrifying. Would recommend finding a different app."", 'Super easy to log potty training info, eating times, accidents, literally just about everything you could think of or need. You can even set reminders for everything including feeding times and medication, as well as other important routines. The best part is that both my husband and I have the app, and we are able to have all the info synced between our phones so that each of us can add information throughout the day. (Great when one of us is at work and the other is taking care of the puppy!)', 'Great app, makes most of what I want to do for tracking my puppy very simple. Would love if there were a web version, if the time format followed system settings, and there was an easier way to log ""nap started"", ""nap ended"" than by going into the sleep item and changing the end time. Oh, and the fact that the app stops working unless you buy a subscription after 20 events with no warning is pretty annoying.', ""Great app for logging doggy activities and allowing other users to participate from another device. This was key in our decision to download and ultimately buy the app. The visual buttons for feeding, pooping, crating, etc are very helpful and the functionality (ease of entering the activity and details) was very much appreciated. It's difficult to think of any improvements. Thanks!"", ""I'm really enjoying this app. I'm primarily using this to help potty train my dog and it's been very helpful to be able to track especially when he's having accidents because you can look at a timeline and see when certain things are occurring so you can make sure to modify your behavior as appropriate (for me specifically accidents). There's way more features in here than I'm ever going to want to use but it's nice to have that option. I would definitely recommend this app."", ""Perfect for what I needed! The analysis interface could be a little more informative (like for example, the Daylio app for people) but the logging interface is perfect. I would recommend this app for anyone looking to track information about their pet, and especially if you're trying to figure out a routine."", ""Great app for anyone wants to track their pet's activity. I reached out to development team to suggest some feature and they got back to me those features are under development. They weren't laying! Now with custom time range option, I can track with more precision. Great for remininder for medication. Great for fine tuning the potty schedule and feeding schedule"", ""I like this app a lot, but it would be nice if there was a chart that better reflected how long after drinking/eating or sleeping puppy peed/pooped. I find the heat map difficult to understand and I'm not sure what the timeline is supposed to be used for. I want a chart that helps me predict how long after drinking, eating, or sleeping puppy will need to potty. There's another app that has that feature, but it isn't as well made as this one so I don't want to use both."", 'Overall very pleased with this app. I purchased the ad-free version so I could compare activities. I really like that there is a place for notes with each activity as well as the option to enter start & end time on activities like walks & training. My only criticism would be that it would be nice to be able to add custom activities. My pup has occasional vomits and I would really like to track these (can use the journal option but I would like a specific entry for it). Best dog activity tracker', ""Fine app. It has issues syncing. My partner and I use this and it will need to be refreshed multiple times and then wait a long time for their activities to be logged. Otherwise it's fine, the smart reminders are a good idea, if that system was fleshed out a little better (base the times recommended to take dog out based on historical data) then it would be much better"", 'I absolutely love this app! It helps me remember so much for my little Molasses, and I also get to document the things that happen like walks, eating, this is very helpful for finding unusual patterns. Overall 4 stars hust vecause you need to subscribe for a plan in order to do a lot of things.', ""Seems alright except that notifications cant happen at all on the free plan and aren't even automatic on the paid plan which defeats the whole point so wouldn't recommend. Stick to Puppy Potty Log. It's much more basic but at least it works and will notify etc."", ""Great app, very fast Dev support. We use this app to log our new puppy's activities and the $20/year subscription is worth it to share the account with our family. There are zero Ads in the paid version. The Devs are quick to reply and address issues as well: I had a previous update break the app for me; the Devs reached out to me within an hour of my reply to open communications, and they put out an emergency patch in less than 24hours that fixed my issue. Fantastic support and App."", 'Phenomenal app that will supercede any other method AND is completely free. Beyond encouraging to find something that is brilliant and in my mind the definition of brilliance is breaking something complex down in a simple way with little more than few words needed!', 'We are first-time dog owners, and we were having trouble training our daschund. My husband and I both got the app and started logging his times. It became super useful to see patterns and habits. 100% would recommend for new fur parents! 🐾', ""Great for fosters. I've taken care of many fosters and love being able to track multiple dogs without having to delete the original profile. I do wish that the app had a feature to share a specific profile with someone since this would be great to pair with dog sitting."", ""Great app for training our new puppy! It's nice to be able to update information from different phones as each person can log details throughout the day. This app is easy to use and has been particularly helpful for our kids as they learn to be responsible for our do too."", 'Perfect for keeping track of toileting, food, sleep etc. Easy to use and already been invaluable as an information store as well as the timings tracker.', 'Features missing: peed/pooped in place/not in place. Goal is to do it in place for as long as possible. Also should have the possibility to log wake up times since it is hard to determine when puppy fell asleep', ""This is a great app and it helped me train my puppy in 3 days and it's really easy to use and super usefull. Also you can when they pee,poo,sleep,play and it's super useful."", 'I love keeping track of my puppies day. However, I wish we could share our schedule for free with at least one other person. And you cannot add reminders unless you pay extra.', ""So far great. Hopefully the free version doesn't have a limit of days/years to record my pup's daily adventures."", 'Just what I wanted for keeping track of time spent in crate and training. Strongly considering purchasing premium', 'Really helped me with my new puppies needs especially toilet training and feeding. Is great for keeping track of growth and weight gain', 'Awesome app! Doggy time is absolutely genius and I have so enjoyed using it! It improves communication with the whole family and helps us see where our puppy is holding. This app helps us divide tasks efficiently between family members. Slight glitch when I transferred to a new phone. Customer support were extremely helpful!', 'It is a big help to know when the dogs have done everything. Also so we do not feed them too much.', ""It's really quick and easy to press a button to log something. It's especially easy when you have puppy brain. Exporting the logs to CSV is essential for sharing with the vet. The new smart features that tell you to pee them after drinking is excellent. I hope to see more like this. You don't need an app like this all the time but for a new puppy, logging is essential when their bladders only last a half hour. The dev responded in about a minute when I had a problem, fixed it right away."", ""I had more than a year of data in the app. Today I was asked to provide my name and email address to continue using the app. Once I entered their code for verification in the app, all my data disappeared. I'm pretty pissed! WTH happened?"", 'It seems to be the best fit of any of the apps for a new puppy, although there are plenty of bugs. *When you click on your pet, and at the bottom there is a list of things like feeding, watering, walking, etc., you can edit what shows up as an option at the end. If I go to the Setting there, and unclick anything there, It won\'t remove any of the options like it says, and will only turn themselves back on. Rearranging shows you this, because when you move things, it turns options back on as well. Sharing with my husband was difficult as well, but I somehow fumbled around enough for it to work. Invite did not work, and ""signing in"" using the same email with a same or his name did not work either. I do not think the Whatsapp text worked. I am unsure if sharing over Airdrop and opening it was what did it, but somehow we got it working. Maybe integrating a password would assist the sharing function? *=edited for better description of problems', ""Do not purchase the paid version, it's useless. I started using the free version and was happy with it. Then my husband and I decided to get the paid version so we could both add entries to the activity section and keep track of our puppies progress, but whenever either of us adds something, the other 1 is unable to see what was added (even after syncing), so the app doesn't work as intended at all. I basically have the same thing I had with the free version, except I'm now $8 dollars poorer.""]",app.kidplay.doggytime,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.kidplay.doggytime&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-22 22:01:27.714850,us,en,app.kidplay.doggytime

being able to have a game where I can take care of them, even though I can't have one. The only things I noticed, are the adds get too frequent the longer you play it, and it is hard to control the dogs on the obstacle course. Just remember game developers, the more adds there is, the more irritating it gets for people, and the more it takes the joy out of the game.

I haven't been in game for more than an hour and it's getting annoying. I can't play with them the dogs in my yard. It won't let me click on them, or even call them back inside. Once they're outside, the buttons all grey out. I also can't pet them usually, for some reason? The hitboxes seem kind of weird, I guess. And they also take some weird turns and clip sometimes."", ""This game is very addicting. I highly reccomend this game to people who love animals. Even though there are only dogs, it's still fine.

Too repetitive and boring."", ""My game malfunctions a lot the dust pan and brush froze in place and my game crashed. and I checked which level I had to open the next kennel and the thing froze and I had to restart the game and every thing froze.

Thx"", ""Limited gameplay, just doing the same few things with every dog. Also the exersize activity is very broken it does not pick up half the strokes I do and misses the obstacle all the time.

Overall ok but not a game I see myself keeping due to the gameplay being broke at times."", ""Please fix this game. The dogs just hit the walls, never stop moving, are constantly trying to turn around and don't do anything, and on the obstacle course, the dog just spins in circles and never finishes.

I use the same tricks on my dog and it works. I honestly recommend this game and it only works in your Wi-Fi so yeah there is a lot of ads but it's so good.

But seriously I\'m a teenager and I really would appreciate more dogs. 3-4 dogs the same breed isn\'t enough. Really said you have to buy these ""other"" dogs.

I got a Dog and she wouldnt go back to her owner, she had her training and everything and she still wouldnt leave! Then she took over the place and no more owners came to place their dogs. I waited 3 days for this to end but it didn't, no other dogs came nor did the other dog leave, so i only had 2 choises delete the game or reinstall it.

That\'s the only flaw of this game... Otherwise it\'s a really good, relaxing, lovely game. Thank you', ""This game is okay but I've been playing and my dog will not move and I'm just waiting for the dog to do something but it'll just stand there drooling so yeah I would like to make some improvements on that because I don't know what to do like has my dog died inside and the paper it goes in and out too fast and I can't even read it so yeah please improve that."", ""Hi I hope u guys respond I love your game however every time I exit the game for a minute and go back to it, it always goes back to five minutes ago and restarts everything I was doing you should probably add a save button because I spent $10 dollars so I can't delete the game please respond and tell me what to do."", 'This game is very amusing and a time killer but do you think you could add a border collie and a fox hound. And can you add the debug menu back because the menu helps me alot. Do ya think you can do that?🤔👍', ""I love this game very much because it is so cute but I just have one question how do you give baths and train animals because my second animal needs to be trained and I can't figure out how to do that so otherwise I think this is a awesome game.▼・ᴥ・▼"", 'Love it! Theres a wide variety of dogs and the graphics are amazing and i dont even care about the ads, anyways, this game is amazing!!!!', ""Too many adds! In this game you have to do activities with the dogs like play with them, wash them, train and exercise. Each thing is quick to do - and after EVERY activity there's a long add! You literally spend as much time watching adds as playing the game. Uninstalled."", ""It isn't a bad game. I didnt get very far into it. Took care of about 6 dogs and enjoyed that each had something different to take care off. So I got to do something new. It was just a bit slow and didnt keep my interest very long. For that reason I gave it a neutral rating.""]",com.tivola.doghotel,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tivola.doghotel&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-22 22:01:31.965391,us,en,com.tivola.doghotel

maybe if the cans moved slower it would be easier. secondly, when you're a street cat/dog, I feel it's really unrealistic and annoying for a gorilla or a tiger to move in. i can just be minding my business, and this weird tiger just kills me out of nowhere. it's very annoying and messes with the game. thank you for reading"", ""An awesome life simulation game! But the reason why I gave it four stars is because of the combat system. The thing wrong about the combat system is that we can only deal one attack while NPC's can do multiple attacks that will more likely to end up with you dying due to injuries. Maybe after we do our attack maybe add more for additional so that it will be fair. I'll put a 5 star if that gets added. Thank you!"", ""This is an amazing game, many choices, good time killer, just a good game in general. I do have a few problems with the game though. I don't think it's far how when we attack another animal, they do MULTIPLE attacks while we only do one. For example, you could do one small attack and they do 6 diffrent attacks and most likely end up killing you. I think that should be changed in my opinion. I also think to escape the animal catcher should be a bit easier. Besides those things, 10/10 game!"", ""this is an amazing game ! I was super excited to play bitlife but as a dog ! the challenges to escape your house, for example, are challenging yet easy enough. I love how many details there are. obviously for just being published it's not going to be perfect but I think it's a truly fun game. the ads can get annoying at times, but buying no ads plus a bunch of other features for $3 is definitely worth it. I definitely enjoy this game, and suggest it to everyone reading this ! 5 stars ! :)"", ""I really love bitlife, and the games new so I understand why it's not as good. It's pretty well planned and made out but I wish you had a option to pick cat or dog, just for more exploration and so. I mean the games good and I'd honestly rate it a four and a half so far. I'd like more details and maybe a few more options to interact with the humans, like a guest comes over and wants to play with you or you can fight off an enemy squirrel. It's really good for a new game! ♡"", ""I had more than one complaint and couldn't fit it in one review. I don't think its fair you can miss attacking a human/animal so many times but they rarely miss. Also, when doing the challenge where I'm trying to escape a building, I think it's only fair the person moves one time instead of twice because it's almost impossible to make it without getting caught."", ""I mostly liked it. The ads are annoying, but there's an option to pay for their removal. The gameplay itself is pretty simple and easy to learn. However, I was disappointed by how crude and gross some aspects were (especially death). I'd like to see the option to play as other kinds of animals soon. I encountered one bug so far: I should've gotten an achievement (the one where your dog drinks from the toilet bowl) but I didn't, even though I did exactly what was required."", ""It's alright, not a bad game. Reminds me a lot of bitlife but with the twist of being an animal, I think that's pretty cool. What I don't like is the limitations the game puts on you even with a premium subscription. I'd kinda like to see more options open up in the future and possibly the ability to play exotic animals like snakes, wildcats, birds, etc. Otherwise completely well constructed game just my constructive criticism."", ""it's a really good game and all like how you get to be a animal and it's super addicting and super fun! but I have a few problems. Whenever you click on something after a few minutes it gives you a ad and it's not fair how you get to attack a animal once and the other gets to attack you multiple times. If those get fixed I will change my review to 5 stars! <3"", ""The game is fun, though it is a but unfair. Sometimes there should be a different option, and when you attack, even if you have 100% strength and everything needed for fighting. The attack damage still rarely does much damage. I also wish that you could play as some exotic animals (with purchase of course) so even if you have buffed out your animal, you aren't still bullied around. There are definitely things that need to be changed. But still relatively fun."", ""I have downloaded this app maybe a few days ago. Its very addicting but i feel as if it is still new. It does have some bugs such as the game does freeze where i cannot click on anything. The app loads very slow when u open it. Sometimes when it freezes i have to close the app and reload. I think these are the only problems but if i remember will update. Also, if possible could u make it where you can change your decision or where it prompts u more if you're sure. I believe these will be fixed."", 'Its very enjoyable and very funny. It plays really well and the ads are much more reasonable than bitlife. However, there is one thing that is broken. The padlock game you need to play to escape from a house if your a pet is completley unplayable. It says you need to tap on it to stop it, but tapping on it does absolutley nothing. If that could be fixed I will update my review to 5 stars. Thanks!', ""Enjoying the game, really. Loved BitLife and the humor is just as good. My only problem so far is when I have an ad pop up, almost everytime the game is stuck on a black screen afterwards so I have to restart the app. I don't think this would be an issue if I paid for no ads or if I had a better phone, but that's not the point."", ""The game is amazing and works just as amazing!!! I love it a lot!!! I can't wait for bigger updates!!! I think instead of just dogs or cats, you should have the option to be birds, or snakes or lions/tigers or other exotic animals. It would give a lot of variety. Also, interbreeding, like, having hybrid children when you interbreed. I think it would be a nice touch. As well as the option to continue as one of your children when you die."", ""I like the game but I think its a bit unfair with the fact that the exotic animals (big cats) have a way bigger advantage during fights. Living on the street is fun but it starts to get annoying when you die repeatedly because you can't kill an animal that wants to fight you all the time and is way stronger than you. I think it'd be better if you could either play as an exotic animal (with premium), or just get rid of them in all."", ""Cute but not much to do - gets repetitive easily (you're either perfect or not). Tried to get the achievements but the ones left are really up to chance. Ads were a pain generally - disruptive and unresponsive - but there's not enough content to justify purchasing the ad free version. Also my dog got murdered by a rat. Freaking hilarious."", 'Pretty good time-killer. I understand why it\'s not all free, but some things feel too trivial to pay for. If a workaround was introduced for some smaller features, then this could be very enjoyable. An in-game currency gained by playing difficult minigames, watching ads, or completing hidden tasks -like sniffing a certain number of dog breeds- would definitely be a fun addition. Also, an option to ""recruit"" animals to travel with, and perhaps a strategic minigame using that, could be cool.', ""ok so I'm only writing a review because I haven't seen anyone else have issues with this. after a while of playing, my phone starts making this ear-piercing sound that almost sounds like a fire alarm is going off. it only happens when I'm playing the game and only stops when I close the app. other than that the game is pretty fun lol. definitely needs more to do but after a few updates I think it'll be more enjoyable"", 'Like others have said, my main issue is repetitive gameplay that becomes stale, which is also often inappropriate or extremely depressing, like living in a shelter or attempting to be adopted. The ""heat cycle"" system is an interesting but weird system to implement. Seems like an appeal to a very specific lifestyle that feels very inappropriate. Even the OG BitLife doesn\'t detail events down to the minute, so why do it for animals?', ""Oh my God I absolutely love this game. I've played so many lives and I love the way the game runs. Some of the mini games are harder but still doable at times. Vet and dog catcher escape are the hardest for me, but as I said, doable. I've just downloaded the game but haven't had much issue. I haven't been able to use the pick breed filter however and I'm not sure if it was meant to be a paid feature but it doesn't work as is. If it's a free feature that'd be awesome but I'd pay for it too"", 'This is a great game. Not as far along as bitlife obviously it just came out. However it has amazing potential. Perhaps you cod make some things to do with the offspring and the human kids. Instead of just them being there. Some of the mini games are a little too challenging for some. Maybe a choice of if you would like to play the mini game or a roll of the dice thing. Kind of like surprise me mostly more things to do for the animal and instead of alphabetical animals categorized cats and dogs.', ""A very fun game, apart from the paying parts. I can understand the usual extra cool things that come with paying; being able to play as a cat, customizing humans & dogs, ect. But you should at least be able to choose your breed of dog without paying. Overall the gameplay is great, with immersive stories, hilarious storytelling, and much more options than Bitlife. If it weren't for the previously discussed problems, would rate 5 stars."", ""Too many ads so far, but overall pleased with the game! I saw an interaction thing in Bitlife mention this and I thought it was a joke, but it ended up being true, which is honestly a nice way to advertise imo lol Anyways, decent game but too many ads. I understand some placements but I'm getting ads without choosing any ad-locked option and this would be much better if there were no random ads. Thank you if you've read this!"", ""I really like it, but there are too many ads, the fact that they are trying to spay/nuter you is half the time when your trying to get help when an animal attacks you is really annoying. Also, if you can't REMOVE most of the ads, then can you at least show them less often? Because there is an ad after four-five clicks or consent ads! And, my game is almost always crashing and it's so annoying! Other wise, great game! Also, can you make escaping the vet easier?"", ""I really like the game but it does have limitations. I agree with the person who said they'd like to be able to be more exotic animals someday. Either in this game or a new app WildLife or whatever where you can only be exotic animals and wild animals and have scenarios more for those kind of animals rather than just cats and dogs. Still love the game though :)"", ""1: Dark mode is an accessibility feature and should be free. 2: We should be able to choose between cat and dog. 3: Every time I get struck by lightning, all relationships plummet to zero, even if they were maxed. Idk if that's a bug, but it sure feels like it. 4: WAAAAYYYYYY too many ads. I have the same gripe about Bitlife. It's so annoying I don't play unless I'm desperately bored. And don't just tell me to buy a membership, I don't have the money."", ""Honestly a pretty good game but it needs more things in it because it gets kinda boring after awhile. I'd love if there was a gamepass to play as more animals like reptiles, birds, or even wild animals like tigers or horses. I would also like if there were a option to practice your fighting skills to help deal more damage and have a less of a chance missing while attacking someone. And just for a update for fun I would like to have option for unatural colors for the animals fur."", 'Ok! So I downloaded the game since I have the original one, ""bitlife."" And that game is very challenging with a lot of options. DogLife has a lot more work to do. There\'s not a lot to do in this game for the animals. I do see potential. I\'m just a litt bored. I however did purchase the ad free. There was too many ads to do anything! I hope to see more things added to DogLife!', 'Overall enjoyable game, but way to many ads, and I mean to many, you get an ad after every other action you make. You fight an animal then scavenge for food, then you get an ad and it repeats forever, it has reached the point that this game in unbearable to play. And I do NOT recommend this app unless you plan on spending $3 for all the content and no ads... Sorry Candywriter, but this much ads is ridiculous, you guys talk about fixing them, but it never ever seems to change. Please fix ASAP!', ""I can't really say the game is good because everytime I click on the app it shows just a black screen. I've tried it on the wifi and off the wifi and it still doesn't work. I personally like bitlife better because you can make different lives and and you can play it on and offline."", ""I purchased the no ads option, the charge went through and everything. I went to play and there are still ads. Tried to contact support by email to issue a refund, and it's been a week and no one has replied. What a shame I really liked the bitlife game but I really can't stand being cheated for money even just 3 dollars."", ""What an odd choice for a spinoff. This game got a lot of negative flak for good reason due to its content, yet if they'd opted for a fantasy setting and/or something supernatural, I feel it likely would have been recieved much better. Much less potential with this one, fun for a bit but I haven't really touched it since it came out. Again, I just dont think dogs were a good choice to follow up BitLife."", ""The game runs terribly, my phone is brand new and its still slow. The ads are everywhere, you quite literally can't do anything unless you watch them, and sometimes you won't even get a choice. Theres nothing to do in the game either besides just press age up, theres no variety either. You have to unlock each breed by paying for it, and its not marked which ones you have so you have to spend 20 minutes even trying to find one if you have any at all. It also took out all the successful elements."", ""Don't complain about the ads. Just spend the small fee to support the developers and pave the way for more content. Awesome game, nice sim, can't wait for more expansions. Yeah it can be hopelessly morbid but I suppose that's life. I just wish the shelter experiences weren't all so horrible. I did foster and rescue for some time and some of the content was jarring and traumatic as far as abuse to animals. Yes shelter environments suck, but we don't beat animals."", 'I love this game. I would love to see an identical game with horses in it. What would make it better is if you added siblings for animal we play as. Think about adding this you could make sibling achievements.', 'Very fun getting all of the tags and achievements! But- my one problem is that it drains my battery sooo fast!', ""good game, lots of potential. Your storyline varies from a pampered boring life with a loving but boring family to the desperate fight for survival as a stray on the streets. some things are obviously not finished yet but it plays well with reasonably few hiccups. the ads... are annoying. the amount is bearable for a free game but do you really have to use the longest ads with hidden skip buttons you can't get to close at the end without opening the Playstore 15times in the process...."", 'Loving the game so far, but I have had a few encounters with optimization issues. When I am playing the game, at random points my entire phone will lag, to the point where I have to forcefully turn off and turn my phone back on for it to work properly again. Never did this with Bitlife or any of the other games I have on my phone. I still have tons of storage left! (20gb+ left.) Other than this issue, loving the game! (Phone model: Motorola G Power 2021)', 'I love this game. It is so fun and interesting. But have you ever considered expanding it so you can play as some of the other animals that it shows in the game? For example, I would love to play as a snake or a tiger or something. It would be so cool. I also wish I could interact between this game and my BitLife. Like my current BitLife character to be able to adopt the pet I have in dog life. Either way it is still a super fun game.', 'Bought the top dog thing on my old phone, then when I upgraded I no longer have access to it. However, I can\'t buy it again because it tells me I already own this item, and when I click ""restore earlier purchase"" it acts like it has restored it but I still don\'t have access to the features I paid for. I\'ll def up my rating when this issue gets dealt with.']",com.candywriter.doglife,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.candywriter.doglife&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-22 22:01:34.789610,us,en,com.candywriter.doglife

The game just broke for me entirely. Please dont update your other games like this or I wont be able to play any of them', ""It's very simple but I enjoy that simple-ness. Just some places could be more enproved.. But for me it's not much of a deal to worry about. Very cute indeed.

I found a family game of the dods finally I find a family game. But in this game not very realistic version . Hopefully the game is realistic later.', ""The game is soo nice but i want to let u add 1 thing, may we have more skin pls? And for rating 5 stars! And 1 problem it's why my friend list dissapears?"", ""Pls update the game! It's fun but it gets boring after awhile. Here's some ideas I have to make the game a little more interesting, I want to see the upstairs of the house, more breeds, more customization with the breeds, and being able to customize the house. That's all of the ideas i have pls make a few or more possible! The game would be so much better if you did!"", 'I love it but it does need a update here are some ideas -more skins -new map -events like in wildcraft -chest to get skins I would love to have some of that in the game', ""The game is good it works fine for me on single player but when I switch to multiplayer it kinda lags alot idk if it's just my device"", ""I love this game but since the updates it's not really fun anymore because there is no free coins anymore and I love getting free coins to see more games"", 'This is a very amazing game I like it very much the only problem I have sometimes the mate have got stuck.', ""I would give you a 5 star rating it's just the game is a bit sloppy....we need more dog colours and dog breeds And even more places and it needs to be more realistic.And a easier way of getting quest done it takes me forever to get some done and I want to be able to collect things like a collar and I want owners thank for the game hope you can fix this:)!!!!!"", ""I enjoy it, it's fun. It gets annoying and boring after a while though. Some of the tasks are hard to take care of. It might ask me to attack 3 humans but I'll end up only finding 2 out of the whole map. My dogs constantly get stuck behind something. Oftentimes they phase through whatever is holding them back and they cant go around the obstacle at all bc they're literally inside it. I mostly play the game because one of the dogs looks EXACTLY like my black mouth Cur <3 that's the only reason"", ""It's not a bad game but it does seem annoying when it comes to the ads in every single gameplay. The varieties of dogs to buy is kinda interesting yet you always have to grind for coins, which takes forever to get more. Even the quest are slow, why do we have to take an hour or so for a quest to pop up? It's agonizing just to wait for a few hours till you get a quest and then after completing it. ANOTHER couple MORE hours for it to load, SERIOUSLY!? It's ridiculously pointless just to wait...-_-"", ""I love this dog game! The only bad thing is that there is no way to doge a hunters attack and the music is kind of weird and also I don't like where people are shooting dogs it feels wrong and also you can make the houses a little bit more realistic and be able to go in them"", ""I'm my opinion this is a decent game. There's lots of bugs, glitches, and problems with it though. Poor graphics, theyre decent but can't compare to Wildcraft. Family members always get caught on trees and various parts of the terrain. There's so many glitches and bugs it annoying. This isn't a bad game, it has potential, but it needs a lot of updates. If you update this game as much as Wildcraft it would have even more downloads, and fame!"", ""I love this game but please add more to the game. Examples-Mix Breeds to play as, different maps, different AI, different places to have as a home, maybe increase the max level, add daily quests, more bosses for each area like wildcraft, maybe add pets. That's all the examples I have for the game as if now, and I know it's very hard to add things to a game, it takes alot of work and time. I'm not forcing you to add these bits just what I would personally want to see in the game. Stay Safe."", 'Amazing. The game is basically ""Have fun and farm with friends!"", although its rare to see people talk. Back then I was around level 70 with all the skins, but thanks for adding new ones.However, this game can start alot of friendships, but last time I saw the game it was 3+. Now this is going to attract alot of disgusting things to happen! Why though?', ""Compared to the cats simulator they made, this one is extremely glitchy, and a bit harder to control. Also there is no Pekingese. :'( overall, the game is like all the other newer simulators they made. Level up, raise a family, fight enemies. The online for this app actually has more people than the cats, which alarms me since it doesnt play as well. But if your a dog lover, its a lot of fun, both online and offline. 3.5 stars"", ""My experience with this app is great. I've played for only 5 months and I'm level 200! But one suggestion... Could you make it more like cat sim? Like with clothes and hats. There is nothing wrong with this app. Whoever gives it under 4 stars must be insane. All your games are amazing. Thank you for creating these child friendly games. My sister is 6 and is obsessed with it. My parents have to turn the internet off so she can stop playing! Also can you let us go upstairs?? That's all. Merry Xmas"", ""Actually, not that bad of a game! I've played it a while back and here's a tip: The cow boss is a lot easier especially if you have a family of dogs. It only took my 3 days to get all the skins because of it! I really think it's interesting. I only rated it 4 stars because the game just looks a little bland- Maybe a new map would be great. Other than that, it's worth the download!"", ""I enjoy the game but when my friend and I try to connect to the same multiplayer group it immediately sends error messages we have tested it out too and since we can't game together we have lost interest in the game. If it was possible I would gladly play it because it is quite a cute game."", ""I really love this game but after you get to level 200 it gets a little boring. There need to be updates that add more things. 1) The max level needs to be 300 and I'm on level 200 and I can't upgrade my dog anymore because it says I have to be level 201. 2) More skins. 3) Maybe 1 or 2 new bosses. 4) There needs to be private friend chats like WildCraft. Also my game crashes at least once a day and every time I open the menu in single player there's an ad. Every time I leave a game there's an ad"", ""It's not a bad game but it does seem annoying when it comes to the ads in every single gameplay.

It's so addictive, and a great time killer! The prices for buying coins are PERFECT! Can you guys please add gifting? I would love to gift my friends different dog breeds. I wish I can give this game more than five stars. I REALLY recommend this for dog lovers! Getting coins (for me) is quite easy. I spend them all, and I always get more than 1,000 coins a day. And no, I don't buy them I just play and do my quests. BEST DOG SIMULATER EVER!☆☆☆☆☆"", 'Even though the game had great graphics it was too hard to control and the game glitched where the animals could hide and run into buildings. It made them impossible to get to. Not to mention they were very hard to find as well.', ""Game was alright at first other than ads popping up every time I check my family stats or other family members getting stuck in fences. I liked the different dog breeds on here and the different maps. I decided to register for an permanent so I could log into a different device account. I filled everything out but it kept saying This email is already in use so I tried a different email I have and it said the same thing. Now I can't get an account to come back to if I decide to uninstall. Pls fix"", 'This would have five stars but it has problems. 1: Some of the names people have are inappropriate and need to be blocked and they use hashtags and other stuff to say bad words. This needs to stop. 2: When I play in multiplayer with full wifi bars I constantly get disconnected even when I am refreshing lists of who is playing. Frustrating!!!😡 Other than that great game! 😁', ""Dude what happened to this game. I used to have it on my iPad like 5 or more years ago and I loved it, so I downloaded it on my phone and it sucks butt!! Sure the map is bigger now, but it's way less detailed, and you cant interact with anything, like you used to be able to climb buildings in the junk yard and eat out of trash cans. I'm really sad this game got worse for some reason :("", ""This game is my favorite. Now it takes years to change region. Turbo Rocket, WORK ON THIS GAME PLEASE!! I really need it back. I love this app so much, just update it a little more, and work on it. It's like, when I change region it takes 20 hours to change region. It's the best game ver, better than roblox, but just please make the loading only 10 seconds and less ads and actions. Please make it more playeable. Add more skins as well so more people will play it and love it and rate 5 stars."", ""This is a really good boredom-killing game that I would recommend to anyone who likes animal simulation games. The reason I only gave it four stars is because you only get thirty quests to complete,and after that you get no more. Also,the dog breeds are kind of expensive. Over all,it's a good time consuming game."", ""Everytime I go to the settings menu to add points, the game goes to an ad, and 9.5/10 times, the game freezes, and I have to exit completely, and go back into the game. It's really annoying. And my mate always gets stuck somewhere and can't follow me."", 'This is a great game! There are fun bosses, unique areas, and more custom features. This is not a five-star game, though. I really like the concept of this game. It needs more quests, more action! I know you can do it, make it come to life!

So easy to track food, weight, bowel movements, training etc. I love the option to add a photo and ""like"" or comment on everything. Also easily customize your own buttons (for example, we added ""rest"" in addition to the ""nap"" option). Overall great app that we are using as a ""pack"" with other family members who also have a new puppy.', 'This app used to be perfect. All I needed it was to log food walks and bathroom breaks. However, since my initial download several months ago they have broken every aspect of this. It has gotten to the point where I literally cannot open a dog. I have downgraded to a version of the app from 2018 and have zero issues. I have been sending crash logs regularly in hopes that they fix these problems to no avail. I will be happy to fix my rating once stability is back. Edit 11/4/19: The update to 3.8.13 has certainly fixed my stability issues but it has introduced a new problem. On the previous versions that I was using, when logging something a popup overlay would appear in the center of the screen to select the dog and write any notes. However, now it shows a redesigned full screen page. While I do like the aesthetics of this new page, it now places the dog selection and finish button at the two farthest points from your hand, at the top. With a majority of phone screens exceeding 5.5 inches this makes maintaining the leash complex. A remedy for this could be rearranging the icons to be at the bottom and placing the add a photo button at the top considering that most stabilize photos with two hands making the reach less bothersome.', ""This app is the perfect thing that we were looking for. You can create custom recurring events as buttons to reuse. We created ones for sleeping, napping, and crate time. It's really the perfect solution for tracking your dogs habits. Especially great for learning a new puppy's time between eating and eliminating, and bladder control. Thank you for creating this!"", 'Been using this app for a year, since shortly after we adopted our first cat and love it! Pretty easy to learn how it works, no obtrusive ads, and a great system for sharing access to the whole family. The only thing that could make it better to me would be the ability to hide certain actions from the ""Log Events"" screen because I don\'t plan to use some of them for kitty, such as ""water"" and ""pee"".', ""Update 1/17/23 - Suddenly cannot use the app; it won't open, despite uninsta/reinstall. :( Really like being able to log when she went potty, when she ate, etc - very helpwful if you have ADHD! I also track when we train, go for a walk, any health issues that concern me (e.g. scratching a lot), and when she takes meds. I do wish there were more icons or you could add your own, because I have to repeat them a lot for what I track because there are so few and a limited variety."", ""Responsive developer. Definitely the best app available. I'm looking forward to the updates. Currently, no ability to enter time of events at initial entry. The log is confusing to read; maybe use the pet photos on the log also? Currently everything looks the same. My Swype keyboard does not work in the app. Maybe allow for a neutral note entry in the log. To keep track of weird occurrences in the pup's life."", ""This app has been very helpful to us logging three animals activities between 4 caregivers.  It's simple to use.  My only issue thus far is that when I log an activity it auto-selects every pet, and I have to unselect all, then just select one pet.  I can see where this could be handy for larger packs that do things together. However, I would love the option to set a 'default' selection - I do most activities with just one pet at a time.  Having a preset, or having none selected to start, would save me a couple steps each time."", 'I really love this app. I always end up with orphaned kittens that people bring me, and I often do the record-keeping on paper. This is even smarter. There are options for potty going and feeding. I do wish there was a way to keep records about temperature and body weight and the option to have records for cats as well as dogs. Also, a widget of some of the info would be awesome, too. Over all, it mostly filled the requirement I need in a tracking app.', 'This app allows me to customize events as well as reminders in addition to other already programmed preset options for me and gives a lot of freedom in regards to how many events and reminders you can log at a single time. When I had a question, after emailing, I recieved an answer to my question within half an hour. I may have personally needed help but I would say this app is user friendly and simple to navigate. Very happy with it.', 'Needs a lot of work. Can\'t edit/delete a record once you submit it. Can\'t mark an accident. Have to manually enter the start time twice. No ""now"" button for the end time to use it like a stopwatch; you instead have to manually input the end time. Default units are arbitrary. (e.g. for ""poop"" it defaults to a quantity of ""miles"") Back button on my phone always takes me to the dog chooser screen instead of screen I was previously on. Lack of stopwatch functionality is a deal-breaker for me', 'Edit: Thanks for responding! I updated my rating. Looking forward to the new version :) . . . I wish you could delete events, edit events, and add more than three pets (I use it for my ferrets too). I also wish there was a ""vet"" option. Other than that, it serves its purpose and we\'re able to communicate when we bring her out and feed her with everyone in our household.', ""This app is AMAZING. A few small QOL things, but completely offset by how helpful it is. I'm tracking so many things for my cat who has some issues I need to keep an eye on, and this is MUCH easier than notepad. But...... Huge banner ad appeared at the top of the app today. It's very obnoxious. Still very worth it, and I 100% support them getting some income for it. I donated through the link. But maybe if you're going to go the ad route, you could have a paid ad free version? Still 5*, but 🤞?"", ""Update: They fixed the crashing issue really fast! I love this app because its really easy to log what you need to. It has a lot of features to use. However my main reason for getting an app like this is to be able to predict what time my dog will go potty. I was hoping the app would do this for me, but you have to pay $40 a year for it! I can't spend that much a year. I get that the makers of this app need money too, but I wish they would let you buy individual features without a monthly cost."", ""I really like this app so far. The only thing I'm not happy with is in the profile feed. There are some fields like breed and food brand that I would like to add for my pup, but you seem to have to select from a dropdown. Having a rescue mix, my breed is not on there and my food brand also doesn't appear in the list. I would like the option to either select Mix or Other. Otherwise a freetext input field would be much more useful."", ""Though not a dog owner, this app is the best I've found so far for tracking feeding and other necessary reminders for caring for our cats. I would love to see this expanded to include other animal breeds!!! My only downfalls, again not a dog owner but a pet owner who needs to keep track of pet health, are that some of the profile details don't have the option to be written in (food, breed, etc.). Also, I would like to be able to delete some of the activities that I do not use (i.e. outdoor activities). Again, this app would be PERFECT if it included other animal types as well!"", ""Exactly what we needed for our new puppy. Especially if one person is taking over responsibilities during the night, morning, work hours, etc., we can easily see what happened and when to anticipate the upcoming events.The only thing we wish we could figure out is how to share reminders with the whole pack. Right now it looks like it's only visable to the person creating the reminders, but we are using this feature to set upcoming vaccinations, etc. and want the whole pack to get the reminders."", 'Briefly, overall, it gets the job done. But important things just arent options. We play ALOT more then we walk but there is no button for, ""play"". Each picture needs to be really small which sucks. I take many pics that I cannot send. There\'s no place in the feed to write a simple written update. I have to send 2 long texts during the day to give a more detailed update. The caption with each activity has to be under 7ish words. I could write a lot more. Definitely could be better IMO...', ""It's a nice app with a clean interface. I like being able to track things about my puppy's health. However, the biggest downside to me is that I can't seem to find a way to edit or delete log entries. I wanted to add notes to a log after I made it, but I haven't found a way to edit it and I can't delete it and recreate the log with notes. This seems like a major feature that is completely missing. No options to work around this defect as far as I can tell."", ""Not working right. I have been using for a while.. and lately I have been having problems with things not being recorded. I can do the whole process but then nothing is actually recorded. And my app is all up to date. I don't know what the problem is with the servers or the app or what. Please fix so I can be happy again with this app. UPDATE FROM PREVIOUS REVIEW:The developer fixed the issue. And is working great again."", ""Good tracking tool but the exporting data function is very basic and does not allow you to choose specific filters on the data you want exported. Update 2/7/23: App has been extremely buggy the last month and does not allow me to view all tracked events /only shows 1 dog per action even if the action was marked for multiple dogs. I've contacted doglog support multiple times but have not received a response back to my last two emails outlining issues experienced."", ""we use a whiteboard to track feedings, bathroom breaks and play time. Am looking for a digital way of tracking everything 🙂 Cool app and a great idea, I wish that you could have more than 3 dogs in your pack on the app. I've been using 2 packs to cover all the pups and that's been working well. This is the best tracking app I've found yet. Excited to see the frequent updates, it's already better than when we started. Timers from last pee/poop with alerts would be cool!"", ""Just keeps freezing over and over again at the page where you add pictures of your dog. It doesn't matter if you use a pre existing one or take a new one so I can't use it at all. If I could give it zero stars I would. Downloaded new version as instructed and still doesn't work. Freezes every time on the upload picture of pet page."", ""Loving this app so far! I am guilty of forgetting to stay on top of monthly preventatives and this app makes it easy to both log and set reminders for this! I also enjoy the option for multiple people to collaborate with your pack! My only suggestion would be to allow users to optionally edit the timestamp for the logged event. Sometimes your phone dies and it would be nice to be able to back log the day's events."", 'Nice UI with everything we want to track for our puppy, but the stats are broken which makes the app a bit useless. The only stat reported is daily counts of events. There are options for weekly/monthly averages but those only report total counts. I love the simple UI and would consider buying the full version if not for the broken stats.', ""Fantastic app for monitoring your pet's day-to-day life. We had a cat with several health issues and DogLog allowed us to track her health and daily routine easily and effectively. As a result, we were fully prepared for vet appointments with a concise record of her progress and, in turn, the vet could provide more effective medical care for her. Highly recommend this all for any pet owner."", ""The application doesn't allow me to put in the breed of my dog from my profile. Also, all info I inserted got deleted the moment I pressed 'back'button even though I had saved it. I'm deleting this app and finding a working one!"", ""Great and simple way to track daily activities, as well as medications. I added my dogs exact medication by name (custom) and a few other things specific to her. I decided to get premium so I can view the usual time or day we do certain things, and it has really helped me plan out schedules. It's super easy to use and pretty inexpensive for the information you get access to."", ""It's pretty good. I've been using it for about 1 yr now. No ads everywhere and I like that I can filter by event categories. Only problem I have is that I can't delete entries when clicking the delete button. Edit button works but not delete"", ""This seems like a fairly helpful app and I love that you can share with a pack. I need to monitor blood sugar checks, urine checks, etc. You can make the categories but I really need a graph like the temp feature. I'm using a diabetic pet specific app but it is not stable. If this app grows to that level I would likely pay as the other features seem solid."", 'Any useful analytical data is locked behind a premium fee that does not justify its cost. I can do the same stuff with a free Google form and spreadsheet', 'Perfect for keeping track of toilet routines. Can adapt new icons for other things to track. Very useful', ""does exactly what I need it to: helps clear up confusion about who took the dog for a walk and when to help us avoid messy accidents and be aware of our pooch's schedule. the ONE reason this isn't 5 stars for me is the lack of dark mode because this app blinds me every night i take my dog for s walk. otherwise, perfect little simple app."", 'Very user friendly interface. Simple to use. The free version has enough features to get started with what appears to be paid for optional extras, which appear useful but not essential. So, you can get started for free and add the extras later, which is nice. Non-intrusive ads too. It has been very useful for us where there are six people plus two dogs in our pack, as we can each log our shared responsibilities and keep track of things. Very useful app.', ""The app is exactly what I look for to keep track of my pet's daily tasks. It has a simple interface that its easy to use. I can easily add more custom items according to my dog's needs. N easily edit items by pushing the task to left. I do like them to record it in current time, so i can calculate walk time, by tapping walk at the start n grooming(cleaning) at the end of the walk. I really hope the data in the app can extracted in later version so it can be presented in doctor's visit. Thanks!"", ""Good but offline issues - If you're out of the house without the internet & switch to a different app, when it goes to reload, it won't, and then when you get back home again & connect to the internet, all the information you added when out the house disappears. Just lost all the walk, pee, poop, drink, eating, treats, vet appointment logs etc I made when I was out. It's very annoying. It could at least store information on my phone to sync up later if I'm offline. I subscribe too."", 'Was charged for the trial of the premium version. Unsubscribed immediately. Have emailed the developer asking for the money to be refunded. Waiting for a response.']",com.mobikode.dog,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobikode.dog&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-22 22:01:40.853072,us,en,com.mobikode.dog

thing that I'm struggling with is it's way too hard to get the station's automated. Especially when you upgrade them you have then have enough cards to upgrade the dogs so that it can stay automated. Seems like I'm being punished for upgrading. Need to work on that balance, but I love the art and the ideas. But way bad balance issues. Feels like they want you to pay to play."", ""It's cute, not glitchy, not laggy, however.. There is an air balloon that floats by and offers money in exchange for a video. That thing gets in my way so often it's aggravating. Not to mention it's really difficult to get sections to be automated because you don't ever get the chance to get more managers or the money to upgrade them. So in my opinion it's a well made game with a faulty system. It quickly becomes boring when you can't afford anything."", ""The style and design is adorable and the ads don't bother me too much, it's what happens after the ads. The game freezes and stays that way for about 10 seconds and some times it stays that way and I have to exit the game and get back in. I rely on the rewards from ads but since the game doesn't work afterwards I'll skip the ads and the game"", 'The game would be fine without a few things. Its monetization is absolutely horrid and does the #1 thing to piss me off. When turning in ""quests"" you can choose a bonus for watching an ad, or not; however, should you not you\'ll still occasionally get saddled with an ad that will take at least 5-10 seconds away. Then youll also get hit with another each time you ""prestige"". The actual economy itself is also built around either watching ads or microtransactions to progress. I cant fit the rest in.', ""Wanted to like it due to art style, but ads are far too common and intrusive. First you force me to watch one for 15 secs, but I close that only for it to then load and play ANOTHER playable ad. Close that, nope I'm forced into ANOTHER damn ad screen. All for just 1 single damn box or to advance to the next day. Ads completely ruin it for me, so unfortunately it's just not that playable for me. If it was even tweaked a little bit, it could be decent."", 'This game has a cute concept, executed... not well. The UI feels very cluttered, with 5 different ""limited offer"" icons on screen that you can spend $5-10 to get in game items as well as an event icon, and a float-by ""watch an ad"" bubble that can\'t be dismissed that cruises by every minute. You get about three minutes of gameplay before hitting an ad, most of which are short but not all. Would be super cute, but awkward pacing and blatant money-hawking spoiled it for me.', 'It\'s fun, but it needs some improvement. Most ""error"" messages are still in an asian language, not translated, so I do not know what they mean. The difficulty curve also suddenly becomes very high so you\'re just sitting there waiting a very long time to continue to the next level from level 6 or so on. Everything before that was a good pace. Also, way too many ads. Feels like it\'s ads for doing ANYTHING.', ""Absolutely adorable, however I HIGHLY suggest you play I airplane mode, or have a good add blocker, the game forces you to either watch adds regularly, or spend $30 USD on VIP pass which supposedly gets rid of the adds, I'd be willing to spend money on a game, but not that much. if adds don't bother you then maybe a random hot air balloon every few minutes blocking your ability to proceed briefly will? if none of that bothers you then I think you will like this game"", ""The game play is standard for a tycoon game but what makes it frustrating is early on, you run out of biscuits fast that are needed to upgrade your dogs. This makes it frustrating as you have quests requiring you use them but no consistent way of gaining them. Other tycoon games are a lot better about this and it's enough where I'm at a spot of just wanting to delete the game and play another."", ""Since day 1 the bonus box that you can get by watching an ad hasn't worked! It just says no ads and I have unlimited data! No excuse for it not working and so frustrating when some of the missions request that you watch an ad and it doesn't work. Uninstalling it right now. More headache than it's worth."", ""I would give this 5 stars because I love this game. I love it so much I have probably spent way too much money in it. But I have 1 big issue, and that's being stuck on day 24 for over 4 months. I finally got 1 quest done in hopes it'd boost me a bit more and I only got 3 more quests done. The quests are ridiculously hard for this Day to the point where I have to wait multiple days to even level a section up. And even then, it's not enough. It's ok to make days harder as they go but not this hard"", ""Don't let it's aesthetic fool you. This is a game that is so desperate for you to spend money it's willing to make the gameplay worse at every point until you do. I really wanted to like it but it's actually so much more viciously designed to frustrate than most other similar games that I decided after only a few levels it simply wasn't worth it."", ""I really like this game so far. However, I think it's a bit excessive to wait so long for the free gift box and the rotating purchasable cards. I also stopped encountering the Welsh Cookie Jar ads which makes many of the tasks impossible for me to complete in order to progress through to the next stage."", ""The game is fun up until a certain point. After the first few levels I realized that there is constantly soo many things moving or blocking something I want to tap. The art style is cute but once you get over that it's gets boring quickly."", ""As many other reviews have said. Other tycoon games with automatic manager cards do it much better. It's slow to make progress and is luck based whether you get manager cards to advance which only comes in a gift box that take hours to renew. You also need biscuits to upgrade which rarely appear. You'll spend more time watching ads for coins that barely impact anything and get stuck waiting for the gift box for a card than actually playing the game."", 'Game has too many ads, most are ""optional"" but it makes them in the way of gameplay and pretty necessary to progress at a reasonable pace. $25 to get rid of them is too high a cost. Don\'t install.', ""I've spent more time watching non-mutable ads than actually playing the game. Also every 10 seconds a floating balloon takes up 1/3 of the playable screen and asks you to watch an ad for money. This game would be so cute and fun if it was playable"", 'Fun until watching so many ads to get ahead gets to a point where you no longer can progress in the game fast enough. Stuck at day 8 with no way of getting more upgrades to move things along. Tired of watching ads and doing the same thing all hour...', 'The game has too many ads. If you play 15 minutes of the game 50% of it will be taken by ads. It\'s really not got alot of content. Sometimes you can voluntarily not watch the ads, but sometimes they sneek in the button that forces you to watch a ""short ad"". I hate how much advertising there is ok the game to make you spend money, along side the millions of ads you have to watch. It is not child friendly due to the amount of ads. The 5 star ratings feel fake and were bought.', ""Just an app to watch ads. I don'tind ads in games but i spend more time watching ads in game then playing the game. Even when given the option to skip the ad and get less of a bonus it STILL plays the add. It's super annoying"", 'Tutorial has no ads. After the tutorial the gameplay is literally unplayable because of ads popping up everywhere, floating across the screen and forcing you to watch to progress at all. I would give this game -1 star if I could', 'Im currently playing the game and it keeps sending me to the playstore to download an app, there was no ads everytime it did that, its making it difficult to play cause i have to exit the playstore and reenter the game. Fix this bug.', 'I really wanted to like this game but the amount of ads and the ad balloon flying over the tasks so you click on it instead of the task is too much. Gave it a try, do not recommend!', ""It's a fine game. But you need to make sure to watch ads get bonus mission reward. If not, you need to throw in cash. Not very free2play game. The bone cookies are too less for each ads reward."", 'Too many adds! Could hardly play the game for adverts that kept on being shoved in front of the screen. Then they swap the buttons so you accidentally click the button to not get adverts only to end up with more adverts. Too many adverts for such a pretty game', 'The game is really cute and relaxing. But overall the ""error"" is really getting on my nerves & theres too many ads like its everywhere. But its still fun for me and cute, I recommend this game for relaxing and if your into cute games ☺️🐾', ""Cute game but the art style of the ads and actual game do not match. Not what I came for. There's also no customization unlike what the game description insinuates, it's a conveyor belt assembly game. Ads will also autoplay even if you decline the giftbox so what's the point of letting me say no?,"", ""Balloon gets in the way when I'm trying to tap dogs that I can't automate yet, either have the balloon be an icon on the side like the biscuit jar or let me toggle the balloon on and off. I'd rather have random pop up ads than a balloon that gets in the way. Also let me sell extra manager cards for bones so I can afford to automate"", ""Day 2 for me and it's been good so far, keep in mind that this game is like those types that resets after you clear the day. It can be a painful to see all the stuff you collect (game time) gone after you accomplish one day"", ""The ads are a bit too much. I usually don't mind them, but there's a lot Also that stupid reward balloon constantly get sin the way and makes me miss things"", 'Cute but way too many ads. It has ad based objectives and every time you start a new level the music turns back on.', ""I like this game but the problem is why can't we just buy new servings? I thought it was gonna be like that other cooking cat game, but it is way different!"", 'You need to watch a ""short"" ad at random times to complete the tasks you patiently waited for? I don\'t mind supporting developers via watching ads for things, but this was ridiculous. Cute concept for a game but no thank you.', ""I love this game! Super cute 🍭 BUT, i don't like that there are diffrent days cause you loose gold and your progress. This can make me a bit frustrated, but overall a very good game!"", 'Thier other games are much better as AFK production line games. This one progresses way to slow without purchasing in game content. Even with buying VIP, I still am progressing incredibly slowly. Compared to thier hamster and cat Cafe games, this one is not good.', 'The constant adds at the bottom making it impossible to click on things at the bottom of the screen is obnoxious and turned me completely off of the game.', ""This game forces you to watch ads. And when you watch the optional ads that boost you, it's eventually not enough to keep progressing."", ""The game is unbelieveably unbalanced. It costs 150 bones to buy a dog card but there aren't a lot of opportunities to get bones or even cards to get the dogs. You literally can't progress unless you come back every 4 hours to open a free gift just to get resources."", ""Put a two as it showed 'error 403' message of me not being allowed to play?? Didnt even get to play very sad:( when fixed will chnage review, thank you if you saw and fixed the problem im sure its a great game and its just a problem that will be solved in no time 😊"", ""Way too many ads, I'd be fine with them most of the time but I keep getting 30 seconds ads with some even unskippable, gets way too annoying.""]",com.maf.idle.puppy.cafe.tycoon,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maf.idle.puppy.cafe.tycoon&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-22 22:01:43.954487,us,en,com.maf.idle.puppy.cafe.tycoon

Google is not letting me cancel it through their manage subscription tab so I'm being charged for an app that's not even working correctly."", ""I had trouble figuring out how to use the app. It's not at all intuitive. I wasn't using the app and, in fact, forgot I had it. I was charged 49.99 without notice because apparently I was on auto renew. Within 5 minutes of receiving notice that my PayPal account was charged I asked for a refund. They refused to refund my money. Reputable companies send notice that a subscription is going to renew. Not this one! They hope you will forget and charge your account."", ""Initially thought the app was pretty decent, but seriously lacking content for the price point they were charging. But then I decided I'd still use it to log my walks, because it was a well designed app. Wrong. Went for a 28 minute walk, which clocked 1.42mi on my watch, and it didn't record anything but the time in the app. Just bad.

I paid for premium, used the app once to read through some stuff and now the app won't open a couple days after paying. I'd love to use it, but I can't. Can we fix this? If not, pls give me back my money. UPDATE: Woofz openly stated they cannot fix the issue and I still cannot use the app though I paid the $45.00 for premium.

Just 1 or 2 training videos available for free, the rest you have to pay. I understand you must have premium plans.
