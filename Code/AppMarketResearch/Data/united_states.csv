Fetchadate,"FetchaDate is Where Pet Lovers Meet! The place to connect for friends, pet playdates, and especially a date for you!

DATING, FRIENDS, PET PLAYDATES
What we do at FetchaDate is eliminate the hurdle to who you’re looking for. We are the dating app where singles meet over what they already love: dogs, cats, and maybe even exotic pets.

Those who trust FetchaDate are people who treat their pets as family so you don’t have to worry about them not being a “pet person”. Now, we can’t guarantee every person on here loves animals, but chances are they wouldn’t be here if they didn’t.

NO PET, NO PROBLEM
We understand people may be between pets at the moment so ‘No Pet, No Problem!’ Choose from a variety of virtual pets that represent your lifestyle like a bird, fish, turtle, horse, pig, or even a snake!

HERE’S HOW IT WORKS - YOU GET A WINGPET!
You can tell a lot about a person through their pet and that helps make better matches. With FetchaDate, your “WingPet” starts things off making your introduction. Your pet’s picture is seen first, and your pet gives clues about your interests. Why is the pet seen first? We feel this leads to more success, because who wouldn’t swipe right on a cute pet? And, Fetchadate creates a better experience by bonding over common ground.

CHANGING THE RULES TO FIND YOUR MATCH
Searching offers a few options:

1. See a pet you like and swipe right. And, if their owner swipes right on you, find them in your “Matches” tab. Swiped right but not a match yet? They will appear in your “fav’d” tab.
OR
2. See a pet and scroll up to get clues about the owner before swiping left or right.
OR
3. Need to see the person before swiping? Tap on the ? to see who’s behind that pet and select a heart for yes or X to keep fetching.

PROFILES: FETCH - MATCH - DATE
In FetchaDate, it’s quick to create your free profile including your values, interests, and personality. A profile also consists of name, age, location, occupation, and motto. And, you get to make a profile for your real or virtual pet.

You can select 50 miles and the app will still show you someone well over 100 miles away. The passport feature, allows you to search for women in other countries unless you plan on traveling to that country this feature is useless, and theirs no way to disable it."", ""Ridiculous! I remember when this app was less than $20/mo. To ask for almost $50 now, is ridiculous. Pros are search parameters, which are some of the best options around; less profiles seem fake. Cons are that the experience is no where near the price you pay. As with most dating apps, you'll magically receive matches all throughout the period you're not a subscriber, but when you're finally able to see them, they're totally outside your set preferences. Those preferences should apply to all"", 'Decided to try the a month of the subscription to see all the matches that had piled up, 99% were from across the world and had almost no profile. My preferences will reset randomly and show me ""recommended"" matches outside of my search parameters (age difference, gender, location, etc). Sending a like let\'s you send an ""intro"" to stand out - but super likes don\'t? You can still see the profiles of the people you\'ve liked, but not the ones you\'ve super liked or sent intros to. Save your $$', 'Months ago I paid for a subscription which is supposed to allow you to see all of your intros at once. It does if you use it in the browser, but if you use the app it says ""upgrade to A list to see all of your intros"" which isn\'t even the name they use for their subscription anymore! I contacted support, was never given any sort of resolution, & cancelled my subscription. I signed up again yesterday & the app is still doing the same thing - no fix for this ongoing, documented issue. Total SCAM!', 'Still won\'t load past 20 of my ""You Liked"", and is only partially showing ""Matches"". Swiping is clunkier than last update. Can no longer see the intros I wrote to people I haven\'t matched with yet (I think it used to be in the ""You Liked"" section or my Messages). I can\'t find my Matched in my messages anymore if I leave the screen before the ""You Matched!"" popup finishes loading (which used to be ok!!). I matched with someone and sent a message, but I can\'t find it anywhere after!', ""This is one of the few dating apps that actually functions correctly, and has actual humans on it. There seems to be a few fake profiles, or at least some really old ones that haven't been touched in years (people still wearing masks and talking about the China flu). Overall, it's ok, and you can match and chat with people without paying. It can be buggy at times, and the app seems to struggle with distance limitations, but it does do what it claims."", ""First off I really love how customizable your profile is. I really enjoy being able to answer so many questions and getting to see how much you match a potential partner. That's a great idea and no other apps do this. However the base app gives you criminally low swipes before you have to wait to swipe again. I paid for the basic ($34) for unlimited swipes and I don't feel like it was worth it tbh :/ I have 47 likes and can't match with a single person :/"", ""Won't let me cancel premium. Ended up getting billed for a month I didn't want, and it is set to bill me again for next month. So the link to disable your subscription in the app doesn't go anywhere. It's decoration that tricks you into thinking you canceled. You have to log in on an actual web browser to cancel a subscription."", ""OkCupid gives the user a lot of freedom to express themselves which makes introductions easier. I would have given it 4 stars but there are some critical issues with the UI and the backend. First, the Android keyboard is clunkey in app. The poor ability to navigate up and down in what you've already written is a problem. Second, the preferences (age and distance most notably) don't seem to actually do anything. I'm not paying for Primium but in reading reviews that doesn't seem to matter."", 'The basic features of the app don\'t work. The stacks at the top wiggle when pressed but don\'t take you to them. The interface is clumsy as well, and many of the accounts are abandoned but still show up in your results. Also, everyone hates short messages. Half the profiles on the site say, ""say more than \'hi\' or I\'ll block you"", but when you match with someone the UI fills 3/5ths of the screen with your match\'s photos and the other 2/5ths with the keyboard so you can\'t see the text box!', 'This seems like the most outright deceptive and exploitive of all the dating apps. You have to pay to set the range that you want to find people in, that should be a free feature, if you pay for platinum(a level higher than the base payment) you can see who likes you...of 39 ""likes"" I had , 31 of them were from entirely different countries, and of those 39, literally one person was in the mileage range that I set.

The filters do not work, you set your preferences then the app just forgot about it as I keep getting teenagers in my search pool.... Like please stop, I'm not trying to hang out with no 18 yo. Also I'm not a fan of not being able to hide myself from international profiles, at this point I believe you are unable to change this because it fluffs the match count. Also, after ending a sub, I was instantly matched with 30 ppl, super sus..."", ""As time goes by, it keeps getting worse. Paid or not it's the same experience. Most profiles are fake or not active. Conversations can go either way which is to be expected but even great conversations NEVER lead to a date. Which probably means those are fake profiles too just to keep you busy. It's just a total time and energy waste and I highly don't recommend to anyone. Hinge is still the best, although their quality is going down, which should be of no surprise. Good luck out there"", ""Couldn't log in, couldn't reset password, and no, it wasn't in my spam folder and still didn't with when I tried using the browser. Very disappointed. It's also very interesting that every time my subscription runs out I suddenly have a ton of likes whereas when I'm paying I barely have any."", ""Neither I am able to delete the account nor i can find an option to reach out customer support. The whole app is trash and looting people. The free version provides nothing but will catch your attention as you get bunch of likes which you can't see until you get premium version and after that, you'll find out that all the people who liked you, belong to different countries even though you set short distant match. Please do not fall into trap of paying for premium version at all. THEY ARE FRAUD."", ""in my opinion from my experience I have paid for the premium service because I had many likes. When I subscribed, it turned out most of the likes were from overseas. And stop getting many new likes once I subscribed. Also, as soon as my subscription ended, I ended up magically having 14 new likes that I can't see. And did not see the hour prior to my subscription ending. To me this seems super shady and not ethical. I kept running into the same profile I swiped left on. Fin"", ""Don't forget to your PW! I'm currently paying for 3 month premium. The app suddenly started acting funny last night, my profile disappeared like I was a new member, but I still had access to my matches messages. So I reinstalled the app to troubleshoot. I receive codes via text, but the app won't recognize my device, and I'm not receiving any email password reset notifications. There's nothing in my spam folder. Customer service still hasn't gotten back for a previous question over 3 wks ago!"", ""It's not the worst dating app. However, there are too many fake profiles, I was really wanted to like this app. I gave OkCupid plenty of chances and money, but I have yet to talk with a real individual. In addition, the range finder could be improved. There are some benefits of the app, but sadly, it does not outway the negatives. I like the thought of answering questions and being able to match or figure out similarities with a partner."", ""This is the best dating app I've used so far; there's very few fake profiles, a ton of free profile customization compared to other apps, very LGBT friendly as well in terms of profile setup. The matching system is wonky but I like that it's optional. It's also cool that you can even search for others responses to the quiz questions if you really need to narrow things down."", 'I took one for the team and purchased premium for 1 month. What I learned is it doesn\'t actually show you ALL of the people who have written something to you on the free version. The paid version does let you view who ""liked"" you however that is pretty much the only extra feature. You have to pay even more money for extra features. It\'s definitely a rip off. The only thing I appreciate about this app is the questions/compatibility..HOWEVER if people are not even bothering to do it it is a waste', ""Fairly straightforward and I like the matching algorithm. I don't like that you can't immediately see intro messages (you have to wait for the ones who sent them to show up in Doubletake), and that the subscription is so heavily pushed. I also don't like ads that pop up and take over the screen, sometimes without an X button to get out of it, or that you can't see who likes you at all, instead of limited. Love the site, app not so much but is the only way to use their matching system."", ""I returned to the app after a long absence after using it pretty successfully a few years ago. This is ridiculously overmonetized. Every single thing has a price tag now, and you get way less than other apps (for example number of swipes per day). Then they keep limiting what you can do. Can't send a message until after you match, so you're supposed to send an intro except if you want to see more than one you've gotten, you have to pay. It's astounding it still has a large user base"", ""OkC used to be my favorite way to meet people. Back in 2016 I had an 8-9 month relationship start through the app which was great and we still stay in touch. With the newer version I can't even remember the last time I had a conversation go past 3-4 messages. There are problems with people not seeing messages, not seeing notifications, not understanding the convoluted messaging rules, and just not being online often enough to make the service useful. I can't recommend anyone spending time on this app anymore."", 'It used to be a pretty decent dating app - seeing who liked you needed a subscription, but you could always see when someone messaged you (or if you both liked each other.) However, this is no longer the case. Now, when someone messages you the app says something like ""Someone messaged you! Swipe for a bit, the person is probably in there somewhere!"" There is no way to view the message until you\'ve found the person. This has made the app pretty much pointless.', ""With consideration for who created this app and the kind of money they can put behind its development, it is by far the worst app I've ever used, from a purely functional standpoint. It can't reliably differentiate between vertical and horizontal scrolling. Accidentally swiping instead of scrolling. Floating elements in front of text fields. Just awful."", ""The filters and questions are good, and it's decent at finding people for you, provided you answer plenty of questions and that the people you want do too. The pool of people is pretty good too. The reason I rate it so low is because the feature that lets you see what you both like and dislike is usually bugged. It claims loading error on any connection, and while everything else works. That and messages don't pop up when you get them so you never notice, and you can't change this. NEEDS FIX"", '10 years ago OKC was great. It was so easy to navigate and interact with other people. Every time I come back after a long break from it, it\'s waaay worse. Now it\'s absolutely terrible. I hate navigating it. Its trying to be to tinder and tinder sucks. It\'s harder and harder to look at someone\'s profile and message them without being forced to ""like"" them, which feels really forced and weird. Edit to add: it\'s also clear to me now how much okcupid restricts who you can see and how you interact', 'Just OK... Good and bad. Difficult to find matches when the app flip cards showing profiles from hundreds or thousands of miles away. Local search only not possible. Also. I do like the level and depth of questions. If they are actually answered. Tells a lot that you would normally not think to ask someone. The match percentages are a great conversation starter. Still searching. Here and Pof. Wish the best of both apps could be combined into one. That would be worth upgrading to premium level.', ""It's cool meeting new people, and I like the algorithms on this app better than most. I took a break from using the app for a while (back when a lot more of the features were free) and came back to having to pay a lot extra to be able to like more people each day to find matches. Honestly I would rather die alone then have to pay a stupid subscription fee for this, especially when they're that steep."", 'Too many ads for a very buggy piece of software. Poorly optimized for mobile. In particular, I keep getting ""network errors"" when trying to see what we have in common. Also, while writing my bio, I can\'t see what im typing. I keep seeing the same people four or five times (although I accidentally swiped left on someone and never saw them again...). There is no ""undo"" button. Bad at letting you know who has tried to message you, bad at notifying you of new messages.', ""It used to be good when you could send and receive messages without matching first. Now it's just another version of tinder and you have to swipe through profiles and everyone just collects matches without interacting at all. A huge waste if time. Unless they go back to the way it was originally, don't waste your time or the memory on your phone."", ""The App is responsive and pretty easy to navigate. The Questions are a real plus IF people 1) Answer enough of them, and 2) Add the optional commentary. More should be done to underscore the importance of that. In the minus side, a lot more could be done to improve filtering. For instance, I don't want to keep looking at a group of people just because they hit LIKE. If I passed (X), then I should be able to filter them out. And i want to just skip over people (no vote). Just do it!"", 'Your user interface is horrible, hands down the worse of any dating app. The pictures are too small and make it appear that you\'d be able to side swipe between them as opposed to tapping, which would signify inappropriately you like or dislike the person. It requires for every profile, that you have to scroll down to the bottom first and then click ""see details"" just do you can see what somebody looks like. Do better!', ""I've met some interesting potential matches on here, only to have some of them ruined because the messaging system is extremely broken! I would get emails from OkCupid saying I've received a message/response from a match with a preview of the message. When I open the app to read the rest, I find no message from them, with them having the same experience when asking them about it. It's nice to have the in-app messaging, especially for safety reasons. But if it's this broken, it's not worth it."", ""First off, drop the price. I'm not paying $35 just to see that 50% of my likes are from people on a different continent. (I paid before when it was cheaper to find that out.) Mimic bumble. A few bucks for one day would rake in the dough. Second, finding locals on the main search is hard. It expands far to quickly, and distance is a deal breaker for most. The free messaging is awesome, and the matching by % has always been nice. I miss the quizzes."", ""As a long time user, watching the gradual shift from a unique, quirky free dating site that placed a heavier than most emphasis on more in-depth profiles to a glorified Tinder that effectively, and in some ways literally, hinders one's ability to see matches and interact unless you pay a rather steep fee on top of dealing with ads, I'm disappointed. There's so much potential there, but it's all about hook-ups and profits. I miss what it used to be, a safe, useful, inclusive space."", ""They updated their platform. You still have to swipe but now it is harder to swipe. I've been trying to move off the first page for 10 minutes and it won't swipe either direction. Also it doesn't matter what you set as your preferences as they do not use them. I still get suggestions for those 10 years younger than me when I have it set to my age or older."", ""It's too easy to swipe left when trying to look at more pictures in quick match, tapping VS swiping is easy to forget and not intuitive. No rewind button to fix these mistakes, I've accidentally rejected so many women just trying to look at their other pictures. Messaging is free (for now), but everything else costs a fortune and it's only getting worse! Now they limit number of likes too! GREEDY! Too expensive, too many bots, and too shallow with few responses from people despite being polite."", ""The ads are insidious, the app crashes frequently, it's buggy, slow, and generally irritating. The messaging part of the app is so cluttered with ads you'll have to read their message one line at a time. Matching with someone often appears in your inbox before it does on the app, too. Best I can say is that it functions."", 'tbh I absolutely hate the whole swipe feature. I accidentally swipe wrong all the time just trying to learn more about the person. Maybe add a setting to turn it off for people who dont like it. I like how it matches you with better matches, better then tinder. It would be super cool if you added a feature thst let me only match with men with no facial hair, would get to the point way faster.']",com.okcupid.okcupid,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.okcupid.okcupid&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-23 13:20:12.814006,us,en

used which was intimidating in concept ,but I'm really pleased having chosen this one ! It's so user friendly, they have good security features in place, I've only one serious creep. The app flagged and removed him. Out of all the matches and direct messages out of a year I've had hits and misses, except for that one early on, they've all been quality contestants, not meat puppets. So enjoy."", ""I haven't used it in a while, but I returned to report that I met the love of my life here and couldn't be happier! WooPlus makes it easier to locate individuals with whom you have interests than most other applications. You may better identify the types of individuals you're looking for by using the questions, preferences, and browsing choices. It's a far more customized experience than mindless swiping, but you can do that as well. Excellent application!"", 'Customer service handled my issue very quickly and professionally. I received multiple responses from them. A very communicative company. I’m extremely happy with the outcome. About the app, have to say I am so thankful there is a bit more functionality on the free version than other dating apps. I also like the ability to filter which kind of girls I prefer. By the way, the filter system can get more options to filter out people who out of my preference.', 'The app allows for anyone to message you even if you don\'t match, which is pretty annoying and there is not option that allows you to filter this out or turn this off. The ""gift"" option is also super creepy as random people who you don\'t match with can send ""gifts"" which include things like panties and bras. The location is wildly inaccurate and people from 4 states away were showing up. Most features are behind a pay wall. Fed up (creeped out) after 1 week.', ""I'm on ten different free apps and websites, and this is one of my top three. It's simple to use, straightforward, and allows you to start speaking and chat for as long as you like with the free features. I've also met some really nice folks on here. ;D My only two complaints are that it does not always inform you with a number in the upper right corner. Also, when browsing through, it's quite simple to swipe left or right by accident, especially if you're attempting to browse their other photographs."", ""One of the best and easy app. easy to use, great ability to upload pics, quick response, and really good customer service. The dating profiles look very serious and fake profiles are deleted immediately. There's a great team behind it. Even if the app costs some money, it's worth it. You'll find enough singles in your surrounding area."", ""Bad app that's missing a lot of core functionality. You can't manually set a radius for matches so after you're done looking at people in your area instead of just saying there's no one left, they will suggest people who are literally thousands of miles away which is really not what most people are looking for. The match and chat systems are also incredibly clunky and need some work. Overall this app is a total waste of time."", 'Site was pretty decent initially, not as many matches nearby. I still decided to become a premium member for a couple months and enjoyed the features. Since letting my membership lapse, which somewhat coincides with the last update, the site has become extremely unreliable to the point where it is a nuisance to even open. Continually getting message that says ""network unavailable"" and profiles not loading.', ""This app isn't worth the download. It doesn't send notifications to your phone well so either you check it constantly or miss a message. When you get a match you only have 24 hours to respond but if your phone doesn't send notifications it's easy to miss. There's not many people on it, perhaps that may just be my area but it's just overall disappointing."", 'I have good matches on here, honest people. Good first impression. The app is great to use and user friendly. Good features and plenty of plus size people. It also has a very nice design and easy to use interface. To be honest, there is sth wrong with my phone and it freezes sometimes but that was solved in the last version. Good Job!', ""It's difficult to stay active on this app without paying anything. The whole egg thing combined with giving gifts is nice and all, but you only get so many possible matches a day. The UI is clear and user friendly and I am satusfied with the options I have to express myself on the profile. The biggest issue I have is the age range. I want to set it to 18-23 and I can only set it to 18-28 or higher which causes me to have even less matches."", ""I keep seeing the same guys over and over again. limited matches. not enough ppl on this app. not enough search options or criteria to choose from. No height preference, ethnicity, religion etc you have to let them access your location which many ppl like the options of being able to put in their zip code for their location, you may not want ur exact area shown but just your city but on here ur privacy isn't as protected as I'd like it to be, not worth paying for, that is for sure!!"", ""Good and easy to use. Thanks for fixing all the bugs in the updated version! Now it works much better. I am completely satisfied with its features and interface. the free version is really nice, it offers free chances to unlock. It seems few scammer on wooplus most of profiles are real and easy to get feedback. If 4.5 stars was an option that's what I'd give it."", 'It makes starting conversations much easier. There are challenges are waiting for you when you match other. You should take some funny photos firstly that helpful at the beginning. Im sure this is one of the best dating apps in US. Most features are helpful and few fake profiles. All you need to do is trying to be active and patient all the time. I would recommend 100%', ""The App is a great dating app. It's easy to use, nice design and I've had no trouble at all finding cool people to talk to. Its clever, fun, quick, UI is beautiful and it seems few bots. Most matches have been good possibilities. My experience has been fine so far. they do a great job to help plus size people dating. Way better than tinder. So, good job!"", ""Although I haven't used it for very long, I can already see that it is superior to certain other apps. A few swipes, certainly. However, you may see matches and receive a free crush or super for around a week. Additionally, the profile system helps you learn more about those who swipe right and makes it more difficult to create bogus profiles."", ""A good app for meeting other single people. Works well for me, lots of matches, chats and quite a few dates. Not had anything serious so I'm still looking. Yes, there are a lot of people on the app just looking for hook ups. But, I LOVE the current say hi service. I can send a message to someone I am interested, it's great. Maybe time to time can find fake profile but mostly are genuine. The style and design is very nice and practical too."", 'My one problem with this app is that requesting only people close to you is locked behind a subscription wall. I dont think i should have to shell out real world money to get people close to me instead of people that are 9-12 hours away. As a dating app, i feel like having the option to meet people close by is an essential one hence the three stars instead of 4. Not everyone is able to travel and not everyone wants to deal with long distance dating', ""Everything seems great at first. Even got a match in the first 24 hours, way better than Tinder. Bust the app wouldn't let me see it until I agreed to sign up for a subscription. So what the hell free features does the app even have if the most BASIC reason I downloaded it can't be accessed? I'd sure like to get some help on this because this is BS."", 'Easy to use UI. Not sure of the number of users, yet. But at least all matches are quality members, who are willing to have some fun.No fake or commercial profile just legit people looking to talk on it. Very easy to set up and fun to use. Immediately does what it says. I recommend this site due to its really helpful and excellent app with lot of suggestions.', 'Excellent app, very easy to set up and simple to use. My experience here has been very good, I met a lot of interesting people in this dating app. Its better than tinder, okcupid, hily because its free version works well, but limit times. This app was easy to navigate and was useful in searching for guys in my age group.', ""The geographical system is much better than ever before, and now I am matching people nearby, no one from other states now. Distance symbols changed from mile system to, airplane and car's icons. It was a bit confusing at first, but now I understand it means which way can be reached. I'm really satisfied with how the app is being well handled with other people, it's not like how it was before when I was on there!! And it seems like here has more qualities profiles, less bots and scammers."", 'Simple to use, simple to get started, and really fair to all members—including those with basic membership—since you may participate in most activities, including talking, but not originate conversations. The app contains all the safety tools you require, such as blocking, reporting, and advising, and the support staff is available to help you if you need it. The environment is fantastic for the plus-size population without making them feel uncomfortable, and that is what matters most.', ""This app is user friendly allows me to find friends and I don't usually keep friends lol. Love this app! It shows women of all walks, shapes, and sizes! Excellent communication and viewing experience! Worth paying for the plus pack to be honest, free version is not bad, especially if you are into alternative lifestyles. I dont have any real complaints. Overall 5/5"", ""Amazing software! This has always been my favorite dating app out of all the ones I've tried. Those who have seen it are quite impressed with the design. Simple and intuitive use. They were forced to steal every configuration file since they were sick of fighting. This allows you to pass a dozen at once, greatly cutting down on time!"", ""I did meet my current partner through this app, but one of the biggest issues has been the lack of local users, the app also doesn't allow you to just select local people when using the swipe feature, it mixes in users from across the country as well as inactive users. The VIP is cheap, but I have a hard time justifying the cost. I think this app has a lot of potential and might be better in areas with a larger user base."", ""Of all the popular dating apps, this is the only one that (I believe) is not playing games with phoney, algorithm generated, matches. I don't know why but, on this app; I make real connections that result in actual meetings. On just about every other app, it's a lot of back and forth messaging (amongst other things) and suddenly, the other party just disappears. Certainly I'm aware, lost interest could cause that. However, it is accumulated experience, over years that leads to my finding."", 'Wooplus is a really good dating app, it performs as advertised, and give much more reasonable options for single parents than other apps. The algorhythm is far more forgiving than other apps, and I find matches much faster than its competitors, the premium is also very affordable. The only downside is that the app does not work on data, at 5G and full bars, the app as no connection or service, which makes forming a connection with someone quite hard within the app.', ""I wish I had learned about WooPlus sooner. I had trouble locating people on other apps with whom I actually clicked. They just always seemed to fizzle out in conversation or fail miserably in real life. They just didn't feel right, and they were unable to explain why. I've only just started using this app, but it's clear that the people I'm corresponding with are much more compatible."", ""Balanced experience at the moment. I'm trying to update a few things on my profile, and it keeps running an unsuccessful save after I've entered everything. (-1400) Not sure why this is happening as the app has just been updated."", 'This app is horrible! It allows users to list disgusting sexual requests. Yet my profile was deleted due to me letting those interested know what expectations I as for in a potential match. The potential matches are always too far. Very few are in your city. This app is a waste of time. I do not recommend.', 'Garbage app, pretty much everything paywall and the app is not great, looks just okay but no functionality like nowhere to delete messages and most ppl that message you there is no way to block them, that feature only shows for a few.', ""I've never had luck with dating apps, but this app has a feature where you can chat with someone and only after a little while talking does it show each person what the other looks like. I gave it a shot on a whim one night. Call it thanks to either dumb luck, fate, or this app, but I met my first ever girlfriend on this app on my first attempt on the FlashChat feature and I'm meeting her family in a few days. I couldn't be happier 😁"", 'App is very predatory, will actively search people interstate unless you pay for the ""premium"" service. Makes tinder look like a good app. Wooplus used to be a half decent app, but now it\'s just a cash grab.', ""For the most part it seems like a great app that I'm getting pretty into! However the issue I have is a big one The thing is that it's very unclear of the sexualities of other people. Often I find myself scared to talk to people because I'm not sure if their bi-sexual, gay, straight, etc. Id be happy to give 5 stars, but I just wish some things weren't so vague..."", ""It's pretty cool, love that you get notifications for almost everything so you're not waiting for days to heat back from someone. I also like that it's very detailed. The only thing I don't like is not being able to see my likes without paying."", 'I can encounter some great matches in many features on this dating app. Those features are really unique and useful. So for those bbw dating finders who yearn for finding some great dating partners, this is our best choice! I like this curvy tinder app, I get what I want here.', ""Overall, it's a good app. The only thing I would say is that it would be nice if you could choose the region for free as well as preference, age and distance in fact all preferences. If the messaging was free for basic users, that would also be great. Maybe if the person is VIP , use 💎 just a thought."", ""Absolutely useless for me, I've downloaded the app twice now and it won't let me progress any further than adding my phone number so I can't create my account. Going to look for a more user friendly app."", ""Awful app. Most of the people on here are bots and scammers. It's also incredibly restrictive and is extremely hard to actually talk to someone. I was offered a deal for 12.99 for three months. I saw that I was charged for the full price instead of the discounted price since I used this service before. However, on the charge screen it doesn't explain that. Sent an email to support and said they wouldn't refund me and hope I understand. Luckily, Google had my back and refunded me.""]",com.mason.wooplus,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mason.wooplus&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-23 13:20:13.815344,us,en

May have to uninstall if it persists."", ""This game is awesome but it takes forever to load like when I first got it,it loaded fast but I've had it for 2 week's now and it kinda changed so when you get in it takes forever and then you get into the game and this is why I gave it a 4 star rating I hope this helps."", ""Just like fun because it's cute seeing alot of puppies running around"", 'This game is fun lol I love dogs, but there is some ads', ""I really like this game, but I think there are too much ads and bugs. the part that i think can be improved: 1. There are too many ads, like when you want to move room or when you want to collect food (without doubling it). Maybe it's better if you put ads just to get rewards. ex: for packs or speed up things or respin 2. When i watch ads to get double food, it's become 0 not double 3. I think this game is good for children, but some ads in this game is a bit inappropriate for children. Thanks"", ""Only played this for another game, but not even twenty minutes in I had it uninstalled. The game itself is pretty good. Great animation, adorable dogs, and it's not glitchy too. However, I can't deal with the amount of pop-ups that take up the entire screen—all of which you can't exit for ten seconds each. I understand that you might need the ad money, but how about giving us optional ads for boosts/speed ups or something. I'm pretty sure so many others are also annoyed by these endless ads."", ""It's a good game, really, but I wish there were more things to train the dogs. I feel like we should be able to train working dogs' service dog tasks and things like that. More things related to the breed of dog instead of all of them being the same."", ""Logged into the game just fine but there is no dog and I can't go into the little dog store to get a dog cuz they're all locked I went to every section on everything on the screen that I could and could not figure out where this dog is someone please explain to me if I'm doing anything wrong"", 'I breed my dogs but then when i come to complete the breeding it like the breeding never happen but when you try to find the dog . It say it still is in breeding . 6 of my best dogs are supposedly still in breeding but when I hit the nest it just gives me the option to breed again .', 'I really love this app as it is a dog game I thought this was not good but turn out to be great! 💯 The dogs breed is alot! I really like that Totally worth to trying to get Ur dog in the game my dog is a shi Tzu and there is in the game thanks that is totally extra credits for the dog town game recommended', ""This is the best game ever. There aren't excessive ads, you can get diamonds easily, you can get gold easily, and the dogs are adorable."", ""I absolutely LOVE this game! It's fun, adorable, and it teaches young children how to take care of dogs! I love how there are no ads. 10/10 would recommend."", ""This is a really bad game I mean u can't even enter it 😞. For the first time before I entered it I thought that it'd be sooo fun but I couldn't even enter it. It's really just a fake game😒😕. Soooo not fun 😕. If there was an option I would give it zero stars 😒. I really wish that I could play this game."", ""I love this game. It's pretty, cute, friendly and intuitive. One that even the older can appreciate and help them relax. I just think there could be a way to make it less visualy stressing (with a high number of visual elements on the screen later on, with tons of quests pilled and all that)."", 'I like it but I wish they had a Foxe dog in the game thanks for listening', ""It's a really fun game and I sure do enjoy playing it. However, there is a few issues I have come across. It has way to many glitches, it freezes a lot and it sure does have to many adds. The glitches that it is having...the dogs when they move all of a sudden it's like ether the dogs or the game are freezing."", ""This is my favorite game and I will love this game forever good job on making this game I can't wait for games just like this KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!"", ""I love everything about this game except for spinning the wheel when you have a love story. I literally spun the wheel 10 times in a row watching an ad between each spin to try to get a different breed and more than half the time hit the same exact breed and color for one I already have. This has been a consistent problem and generally makes the game frustrating and not fun to play. I've considered uninstalling multiple times because of this coding choice and now I'm done unless it's fixed."", 'Nice game but too many ads and too lengthy. Mostly at least 30 seconds. Why watch a static company logo or black screen for 30 seconds? Even when you claim something, ads comes out. I understand the need for ads, however ads should be 10 seconds at most. Too much time wasted on ads cannot really enjoy the game. Will rate again if improved.']",com.frismos.dogworld,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frismos.dogworld&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-23 13:20:15.763261,us,en

Dogify: Dog Translator Trainer,"Dogify is an amusing instant translator for dogs. Ideal when you can not communicate with your dog, and he does not understand anything! With this application you can say something to your dog or hear how it sounds in different languages. You can hear what your pet is barking in real time!

Try to communicate with a dog or a puppy using the features of the Dog Translator app

- Translation from Dog to Human

- Translation from Human to Dog

Talk to your pets, breaking the language barrier. Favorite pets may not understand the phrase, but they will hear familiar sounds and pay attention to you.


Turn on sounds for your pet to understand what sounds he likes and which ones are better not to play. Choose from a set of sounds you like, click to play and wait for your pet's reaction.


Learn how to train your dog with an ultrasonic whistle. Choose the frequency of the ultrasonic whistle to train your dog or choose from preset sounds for commands.


With this app you can talk to your dog! You can tell him what you are doing, where are you going, what's for dinner... But he still will not understand anything! This is why you can write down what you say so that Dogify shows these messages on the screen! And even if your dog can't read, he will be amazed by this new trick :)


Dogify is a funny app for you and your pet. It has a large collection of dog-related sounds, such as Dog's lullaby, A creepy howl or That's enough, what else do want. You can make your dog bark, howl, etc. Enjoy the barking party with your friends!",Human to Dog Translator,"100,000+",100000,200161,3.0946746,3131.0,371.0,"[1295, 91, 129, 239,

the same people. Not disappointed at all, still has the origins of Nintendogs which I have missed. Need to add the ability to Bath your dog and give them treats though! Overall cute larl game, definitely wanting it on the switch too.', ""As this is a newer kind of version of Nintendogs, I don't understand the point. You must pay for your own dog if it isn't a German Shepherd, and you can't change the fur color unless you pay to do so. May I add, you can't be under the age of twelve to make purchases. It wasn't my childhood, (I'm a Gen Z,) but I'm pretty sure the entire premise of Nintendogs was to choose your own pooch to make fun memories with."", 'This game is amazing!!!! 5 stars. Maybe in the future we can give our dogs a bath, treats and have a few more rooms, but otherwise this game is amazing!! Definitely the best dog care game. Cute graphics, clothes and furniture. I give this game 5 stars and hope everyone gives it a try. I absolutely love this game and recommend it to anyone looking for a nice dog game. Hopefully there will be lots of cool updates!!! Great work on this amazing game!!!', ""Some Reasons I Gave This Game a 3 : 1. You cannot have play with a bunch of dogs in the same room only just one.. 2. Lots of the things in the shop are very expensive in my opinion... 3. It's also unfair for me because only the German Shepherd and the Toy Poodle are free but some of their colour tones you can have with Real Money... Soooooo those are my reasons, I know that they're a bit arrogant and shows the game's flaws but I think it's better to be honest even if the truth hurts!"", ""This game is forcing, I can hardly do what I want and at the start it says 'choose your first pet' or something along the lines, and you literally only have the option of a boring blonde thing. You get to choose the colours as black and white but you still end up with a boring blonde thing. Disappointing really."", 'I have the cat version too and absolutely adore both games.

Please can you add more dog breeds one day. This game is 10/10', ""The graphics are good but everything else is a bust. Money money money. All this game cares about. You have to pay REAL MONEY just for your dog to learn ONE TRICK!! Like come on not cool. And in the begging it says to pick your dog, but it doesnt even let ME choose the dog. If I could give 0 stars, i would. But I can't. Heart broken this game is a pay to play thought I found a good game."", ""This is an amazing game with lots of features!!!! I think towards the future this game could have maybe a few more dog breeds as well as more rooms, a bath feature, being able to give your dog a treat and maybe more personalitys for the puppys!!!!!! Other than that this it deserves 5 stars in my opinion and it's a great quality dog game simulation!! :D"", 'I almost never leave low reviews. If I dislike a game I just move on. However, anyone thinking of playing this game should know that you will install the game, be forced to wait for another 400mb installation once you load the game, enter your birthdate, and then after all that the game randomly selects which pet you need to spend your time with. The others are locked behind a paywall. Isnt the point of the game to offer power of choice with a pet that fits your likes? I mean... just no.', ""It's such a cute game, pretty similar to nintendogs. But that's why I love it! But i wish you you guys could add bubble baths for the dogs, bc it's more fun to wash them then brush. I also kinda want you guys to add treats, when a dog behaves u can give it a treat or when it does tricks :D"", ""Perfect for kids and nostalgic adults who grew up with Nintendogs. Has the most fair monetization I've seen in a free game (few ads. No cryptocurrency, prices are in dollars. Things like tricks that are paywalled are not necessary to enjoy gameplay, and prices are cheap) so parents can feel safe letting their kids play. Gameplay is Nintendogs lite. Not a lot of content, but very good at scratching that itch for a loving pet.

Would have been nice if I could actually play though. Downloaded the content but the app would never start. Kept kicking me out. Really unfortunate.', ""The shibas are so cute! But unfortunately every dog except for the toy poodle cost 5$ each (per color) it's clear that effort went into this game so I won't give 1 star but I believe that the page is misleading, advertising all the dogs you won't get. also this is a blatant Nintendogs ripoff"", 'Save your time, game crashes on startup every single time. Not optimized well at all. I have a Google pixel 6 so nothing wrong on my end, again, save your time.', ""It's a nice game although it says that there are 190 different breeds in the description. There only appears to be 8 and there's constant paywalls to unlock the dogs very misleading"", ""Also, first things first, I have this game on Switch too, BUT why the Switch version don't has the day night systhem like here?! I was so happy when I saw the same game here but with the Day night systhem! Csn't you update it to the switch version too? The graphics are OK I love it how it is. Sadly Is you have to pay for other dogs and colours but ok. At the end the games remember me here more to Nintendogs instead of the Switch cuz the day night systhem is missing.."", ""It's a really cute game.... But it keeps lagging, When I try to purchase something it crashes. Please fix the issue. Thanks"", ""Oh my god, finally a true successor to Nintendogs. I can't even tell you how badly I've been wanting something exactly like this on mobile. Just. Oh man this is fabulous. Thanks, devs!"", ""I like the it's simple and easy to interact with. I hope there's more breeds and more activities to play with. So far it's nice game and I'm looking forward for the updates of the game. 😊🤩"", ""Too bad they no longer update the game and haven't since 2022 😩 need more breeds and events, need more to do. It's a great game tho, reminds me of nintendogs haha 😅 runs very well on phone 🙏🏻"", 'This app is very glitchy and has a lot of downloading at the beginning that takes forever to download.', 'Love the game but wished there was more stuff you could do with your fury friend.

I'd be lost without it. There've been a few bugs along the way but they are always responsive and fixed quickly. I especially like some of the recent changes to the events like the drop-down in Medicine to specify the type. It's a lifesaver for multi-carer packs & dogs with health issues, being able to easily create a log of everything to share with the vet is priceless."", ""I like the app as it is very useful to be able to quickly make notes about your dog that will be organised and sorted in a nice way so you can easily go back to it. However a few things could be improved. One thing is the weight curve. The X-axis should be your pet's age, not the number increment of your measurement. If you don't weigh your pet continuously you will not see the slopes of weight gain/loss as realistic in the time dimension."", ""Love the simplicity of the interface with the option to add more activities (repeating for a common task or once, like a skunk attack!). Tracking my 11 week old puppy for the past 2 weeks has been extremely helpful. I can see patterns in what times he eats, when we go outside, when he's most likely to have an accident. would be better if you could adjust the time of the event as you are entering it instead of defaulting to current time. Slow app loading screen can be frustrating."", 'Great app, especially for pups with multiple caregivers so you\'re not constantly texting each other ""did you walk the dog before you left?"". Intuitive and the simple interface makes it easy to add entries with one hand while being dragged along by over-enthusiastic puppies! The most recent release addressed the only two things I didn\'t like about the app.', 'Great app for tracking a new puppy\'s every move. So easy to track food, weight, bowel movements, training etc. I love the option to add a photo and ""like"" or comment on everything. Also easily customize your own buttons (for example, we added ""rest"" in addition to the ""nap"" option). Overall great app that we are using as a ""pack"" with other family members who also have a new puppy.', 'This app used to be perfect. All I needed it was to log food walks and bathroom breaks. However, since my initial download several months ago they have broken every aspect of this. It has gotten to the point where I literally cannot open a dog. I have downgraded to a version of the app from 2018 and have zero issues. I have been sending crash logs regularly in hopes that they fix these problems to no avail. I will be happy to fix my rating once stability is back. Edit 11/4/19: The update to 3.8.13 has certainly fixed my stability issues but it has introduced a new problem. On the previous versions that I was using, when logging something a popup overlay would appear in the center of the screen to select the dog and write any notes. However, now it shows a redesigned full screen page. While I do like the aesthetics of this new page, it now places the dog selection and finish button at the two farthest points from your hand, at the top. With a majority of phone screens exceeding 5.5 inches this makes maintaining the leash complex. A remedy for this could be rearranging the icons to be at the bottom and placing the add a photo button at the top considering that most stabilize photos with two hands making the reach less bothersome.', ""This app is the perfect thing that we were looking for. You can create custom recurring events as buttons to reuse. We created ones for sleeping, napping, and crate time. It's really the perfect solution for tracking your dogs habits. Especially great for learning a new puppy's time between eating and eliminating, and bladder control. Thank you for creating this!"", 'Been using this app for a year, since shortly after we adopted our first cat and love it! Pretty easy to learn how it works, no obtrusive ads, and a great system for sharing access to the whole family. The only thing that could make it better to me would be the ability to hide certain actions from the ""Log Events"" screen because I don\'t plan to use some of them for kitty, such as ""water"" and ""pee"".', ""Update 1/17/23 - Suddenly cannot use the app; it won't open, despite uninsta/reinstall. :( Really like being able to log when she went potty, when she ate, etc - very helpwful if you have ADHD! I also track when we train, go for a walk, any health issues that concern me (e.g. scratching a lot), and when she takes meds. I do wish there were more icons or you could add your own, because I have to repeat them a lot for what I track because there are so few and a limited variety."", ""Responsive developer. Definitely the best app available. I'm looking forward to the updates. Currently, no ability to enter time of events at initial entry. The log is confusing to read; maybe use the pet photos on the log also? Currently everything looks the same. My Swype keyboard does not work in the app. Maybe allow for a neutral note entry in the log. To keep track of weird occurrences in the pup's life."", ""This app has been very helpful to us logging three animals activities between 4 caregivers.  It's simple to use.  My only issue thus far is that when I log an activity it auto-selects every pet, and I have to unselect all, then just select one pet.  I can see where this could be handy for larger packs that do things together. However, I would love the option to set a 'default' selection - I do most activities with just one pet at a time.  Having a preset, or having none selected to start, would save me a couple steps each time."", 'I really love this app. I always end up with orphaned kittens that people bring me, and I often do the record-keeping on paper. This is even smarter. There are options for potty going and feeding. I do wish there was a way to keep records about temperature and body weight and the option to have records for cats as well as dogs. Also, a widget of some of the info would be awesome, too. Over all, it mostly filled the requirement I need in a tracking app.', 'This app allows me to customize events as well as reminders in addition to other already programmed preset options for me and gives a lot of freedom in regards to how many events and reminders you can log at a single time. When I had a question, after emailing, I recieved an answer to my question within half an hour. I may have personally needed help but I would say this app is user friendly and simple to navigate. Very happy with it.', 'Needs a lot of work. Can\'t edit/delete a record once you submit it. Can\'t mark an accident. Have to manually enter the start time twice. No ""now"" button for the end time to use it like a stopwatch; you instead have to manually input the end time. Default units are arbitrary. (e.g. for ""poop"" it defaults to a quantity of ""miles"") Back button on my phone always takes me to the dog chooser screen instead of screen I was previously on. Lack of stopwatch functionality is a deal-breaker for me', 'Edit: Thanks for responding! I updated my rating. Looking forward to the new version :) . . . I wish you could delete events, edit events, and add more than three pets (I use it for my ferrets too). I also wish there was a ""vet"" option. Other than that, it serves its purpose and we\'re able to communicate when we bring her out and feed her with everyone in our household.', ""This app is AMAZING. A few small QOL things, but completely offset by how helpful it is. I'm tracking so many things for my cat who has some issues I need to keep an eye on, and this is MUCH easier than notepad. But...... Huge banner ad appeared at the top of the app today. It's very obnoxious. Still very worth it, and I 100% support them getting some income for it. I donated through the link. But maybe if you're going to go the ad route, you could have a paid ad free version? Still 5*, but 🤞?"", ""Update: They fixed the crashing issue really fast! I love this app because its really easy to log what you need to. It has a lot of features to use. However my main reason for getting an app like this is to be able to predict what time my dog will go potty. I was hoping the app would do this for me, but you have to pay $40 a year for it! I can't spend that much a year. I get that the makers of this app need money too, but I wish they would let you buy individual features without a monthly cost."", ""I really like this app so far. The only thing I'm not happy with is in the profile feed. There are some fields like breed and food brand that I would like to add for my pup, but you seem to have to select from a dropdown. Having a rescue mix, my breed is not on there and my food brand also doesn't appear in the list. I would like the option to either select Mix or Other. Otherwise a freetext input field would be much more useful."", ""Though not a dog owner, this app is the best I've found so far for tracking feeding and other necessary reminders for caring for our cats. I would love to see this expanded to include other animal breeds!!! My only downfalls, again not a dog owner but a pet owner who needs to keep track of pet health, are that some of the profile details don't have the option to be written in (food, breed, etc.). Also, I would like to be able to delete some of the activities that I do not use (i.e. outdoor activities). Again, this app would be PERFECT if it included other animal types as well!"", ""Exactly what we needed for our new puppy. Especially if one person is taking over responsibilities during the night, morning, work hours, etc., we can easily see what happened and when to anticipate the upcoming events.The only thing we wish we could figure out is how to share reminders with the whole pack. Right now it looks like it's only visable to the person creating the reminders, but we are using this feature to set upcoming vaccinations, etc. and want the whole pack to get the reminders."", 'Briefly, overall, it gets the job done. But important things just arent options. We play ALOT more then we walk but there is no button for, ""play"". Each picture needs to be really small which sucks. I take many pics that I cannot send. There\'s no place in the feed to write a simple written update. I have to send 2 long texts during the day to give a more detailed update. The caption with each activity has to be under 7ish words. I could write a lot more. Definitely could be better IMO...', ""It's a nice app with a clean interface. I like being able to track things about my puppy's health. However, the biggest downside to me is that I can't seem to find a way to edit or delete log entries. I wanted to add notes to a log after I made it, but I haven't found a way to edit it and I can't delete it and recreate the log with notes. This seems like a major feature that is completely missing. No options to work around this defect as far as I can tell."", ""Not working right. I have been using for a while.. and lately I have been having problems with things not being recorded. I can do the whole process but then nothing is actually recorded. And my app is all up to date. I don't know what the problem is with the servers or the app or what. Please fix so I can be happy again with this app. UPDATE FROM PREVIOUS REVIEW:The developer fixed the issue. And is working great again."", ""Good tracking tool but the exporting data function is very basic and does not allow you to choose specific filters on the data you want exported. Update 2/7/23: App has been extremely buggy the last month and does not allow me to view all tracked events /only shows 1 dog per action even if the action was marked for multiple dogs. I've contacted doglog support multiple times but have not received a response back to my last two emails outlining issues experienced."", ""we use a whiteboard to track feedings, bathroom breaks and play time. Am looking for a digital way of tracking everything 🙂 Cool app and a great idea, I wish that you could have more than 3 dogs in your pack on the app. I've been using 2 packs to cover all the pups and that's been working well. This is the best tracking app I've found yet. Excited to see the frequent updates, it's already better than when we started. Timers from last pee/poop with alerts would be cool!"", ""Just keeps freezing over and over again at the page where you add pictures of your dog. It doesn't matter if you use a pre existing one or take a new one so I can't use it at all. If I could give it zero stars I would. Downloaded new version as instructed and still doesn't work. Freezes every time on the upload picture of pet page."", ""Loving this app so far! I am guilty of forgetting to stay on top of monthly preventatives and this app makes it easy to both log and set reminders for this! I also enjoy the option for multiple people to collaborate with your pack! My only suggestion would be to allow users to optionally edit the timestamp for the logged event. Sometimes your phone dies and it would be nice to be able to back log the day's events."", 'Nice UI with everything we want to track for our puppy, but the stats are broken which makes the app a bit useless. The only stat reported is daily counts of events. There are options for weekly/monthly averages but those only report total counts. I love the simple UI and would consider buying the full version if not for the broken stats.', ""Fantastic app for monitoring your pet's day-to-day life. We had a cat with several health issues and DogLog allowed us to track her health and daily routine easily and effectively. As a result, we were fully prepared for vet appointments with a concise record of her progress and, in turn, the vet could provide more effective medical care for her. Highly recommend this all for any pet owner."", ""The application doesn't allow me to put in the breed of my dog from my profile. Also, all info I inserted got deleted the moment I pressed 'back'button even though I had saved it. I'm deleting this app and finding a working one!"", ""Great and simple way to track daily activities, as well as medications. I added my dogs exact medication by name (custom) and a few other things specific to her. I decided to get premium so I can view the usual time or day we do certain things, and it has really helped me plan out schedules. It's super easy to use and pretty inexpensive for the information you get access to."", ""It's pretty good. I've been using it for about 1 yr now. No ads everywhere and I like that I can filter by event categories. Only problem I have is that I can't delete entries when clicking the delete button. Edit button works but not delete"", ""This seems like a fairly helpful app and I love that you can share with a pack. I need to monitor blood sugar checks, urine checks, etc. You can make the categories but I really need a graph like the temp feature. I'm using a diabetic pet specific app but it is not stable. If this app grows to that level I would likely pay as the other features seem solid."", 'Any useful analytical data is locked behind a premium fee that does not justify its cost. I can do the same stuff with a free Google form and spreadsheet', 'Perfect for keeping track of toilet routines. Can adapt new icons for other things to track. Very useful', ""does exactly what I need it to: helps clear up confusion about who took the dog for a walk and when to help us avoid messy accidents and be aware of our pooch's schedule. the ONE reason this isn't 5 stars for me is the lack of dark mode because this app blinds me every night i take my dog for s walk. otherwise, perfect little simple app."", 'Very user friendly interface. Simple to use. The free version has enough features to get started with what appears to be paid for optional extras, which appear useful but not essential. So, you can get started for free and add the extras later, which is nice. Non-intrusive ads too. It has been very useful for us where there are six people plus two dogs in our pack, as we can each log our shared responsibilities and keep track of things. Very useful app.', ""The app is exactly what I look for to keep track of my pet's daily tasks. It has a simple interface that its easy to use. I can easily add more custom items according to my dog's needs. N easily edit items by pushing the task to left. I do like them to record it in current time, so i can calculate walk time, by tapping walk at the start n grooming(cleaning) at the end of the walk. I really hope the data in the app can extracted in later version so it can be presented in doctor's visit. Thanks!"", ""Good but offline issues - If you're out of the house without the internet & switch to a different app, when it goes to reload, it won't, and then when you get back home again & connect to the internet, all the information you added when out the house disappears. Just lost all the walk, pee, poop, drink, eating, treats, vet appointment logs etc I made when I was out. It's very annoying. It could at least store information on my phone to sync up later if I'm offline. I subscribe too."", 'Was charged for the trial of the premium version. Unsubscribed immediately.

Recently though, the events are just reskins of either floors from Cat Game or repeats of already past events. While a little repeat is to be expected, it just seems like they stopped caring about working on this game. Getting to the point where I am done with the regular tower and there are no options to continue, unless I spend actual money. Getting a little disappointed, because it is a fun game most times.', ""Great game! I really love it and I enjoy it. I think it runs smoothy and it's really fun to collect dogs. I do have one thing that bothers me. Recently I've been having to uninstall and reinstall the game because it keeps glitching. Whenever I load the game up and I'm waiting in the loading screen once it gets to 100% the dog glitches out and then my screen goes black. Nothing happens after that and it's been happening recently. I hope this can get fixed. It's still a great game, love it!"", ""Cute and fun time waster about collecting dogs! I haven't been able to put it down! For such a simple concept it sure is fun. It's a bit money hungry but not overly so. A purchase removes ads, at least. They are generous with premium currency so that's always a plus. It would be nicer if there were more than 2 mini games to earn coins, though. Overall I'm happy with this game. The dogs are super cute, there are a ton of different ones (real and fantasy) and the wait times are not that bad!"", ""The cuteness can't be denied, and I love how every dog has their own unique animation - that makes the collecting all the more worthwhile! My main gripe is that advancing depends heavily on crafting, which takes a good amount of both resources and coins, which are hard to earn with only two mini games. There's a whole lot of waiting involved (wait for boxes to be delivered, wait for food options to be refreshed, wait for crafting to be completed) and the minigames are both pretty short plays."", ""I really love the game but I've recently started having issues with booting the game up. It will load the start screen and once it starts loading, it give me a black screen and I can no longer play it. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it a couple of times and it loads my save, vut after a few times of playing, it give me the dreaded black screen again. Not sure who to contact because the black screen won't really allow me to contact anyone. 😕"", ""Recently it's just been glitching out at the loading screen and going black. I've been trying for a week or so now just to get loaded into the game, but it will instead freeze up and sometimes make me restart my phone entirely. It was fun for a bit, I guess, and I like it more than CG because I'm a dog person... but it is quite literally unplayable."", ""This is my updated review! It took a few trys to actually get the game to the point where i had a game id and it would save my progress. The game is addicting but you have to be lucky with the spins in the beginning to actually be able to move on. Its not a problem after you get past the tutorial part but in the beginning if you keep getting dogs then you don't have enough supplies to continue and you have to start over. This needs to be fixed for future players! It is still a pretty fun game!"", ""After continuously getting the black screen when trying to load, I deleted the game then re-installed it. It worked! But now it's doing the same thing AGAIN. I'm missing another event because of these issues, and I did very much enjoy the game.

And sometimes when you watch an ad, it completely freezes the game (sometimes my phone too) and then crashes. Also the percentage of landing a dog the further you go is annoying. I want to continue to get more rooms, not collect an over amount of materials."", ""This game is super fun to play casually when you need something to do. The mini games are super user friendly and super helpful when you need some coins.

Other than that, not disappointed!☺️"", ""The game is cute. Its just as fun as cat collector, which I've played for almost 3 years now. But this one has too any ads! After each round of game play there is an ad before you get your coins. Ger rid of that please! There is a glitch in the doggopedia, I can't see most of my dogs, and when I scroll through it, it doesn't work correctly. Each time I deliver a basket or feed for supplies, instead of going back where I was, I'm taken to the top of the tower. It's just frustrating."", ""Crafting recipes are so difficult. Would definitely like to see them be changed to be like Cat Game's recipes. An option to permanently opt out of global chat (CG got this recently) would be amazing. I think the % chance of getting a dog is a lie, feels like I have to wait and spin so many times before I get one. I love this game, I'm enjoying it even more than CG (that I've played for 2+ years and am almost max level on).

I've tried on two separate phones and tried re-downloading it. When it does finally load it works for a few minutes and then crashes.

After waiting for a few months for it to catch onto some of CG's better qualities and not just compile its worst the game only presented a black screen every time I attempted to log into it.

Since I know the first thing is always suggested to Uninstaller and reinstall, I did that and the game started me over and says backup and restoring can't be done.

I like to support games I'm fond of so I've allowed myself to purchase ONE floor from each, and otherwise haven't felt compelled to purchase anything at all to proceed. I do wish there were more mini games I admit, a simple endless runner I believe would go over really well, but all in all a lot of fun, can't complain!"", ""I wrote this review on the cat alternative so I figured I'd mention it here too. It's an amazing game but there are some wifi troubles. It could just be me but for both games I have to frequently switch my wifi on and off because you need wifi to play but the game won't load when it's on. Sometimes you need wifi to do things and sometimes you can play offline perfectly fine which is weird. Other than that it's sooo adorable and I highly recommend it!!"", ""This app won't work properly for me. I downloaded it, chose my starter dog, then it went to the house and the only thing it showed was the floor and the dog I chose. No tutorial.

So I closed the app and got back in and it restarted. From the beginning where you choose the dog."", ""I've played dg for 2 yrs and cg for 1 yr. Lately cg has become unplayable due to lag. I worry the same will happen here after having invested thousands of hrs and $. Dog Game lacks some features from Cat Game & the crafting + leveling is overall more difficult. It lacks a full VIP reward system as well. My biggest issue is with player support. Often we feel ignored with our feedback & concerns. We know we won't get help from certain support staff. Bugs are left unfixed & there is no compensation"", 'Really great game with awesome drawings. The one thing that I would complain about is the ads; right after you play a mini game,it just gives you a pop-up ad. I believe this is similar to the cat game, so if you are interested in the game, this game will surely spark your interest.', ""its awsome! i love it so cute the one thing that bothers me is when you get a puppy it comes in a basket and when you get to a higher level it take soo long to get out of the basket but it isn't to big of a problem so i still give it five stars its a very fun game so i recomend it its very cute i play it so much"", ""I really love the game:) 1.

It does have very few ads, but it can take a really long time to get a basket. Otherwise, It's very fun!"", ""Very cute game. I love this game and CG, but I play this more since I'm more of a dog person than a cat person. The only real issue I have with it is that sometimes the loading gets stuck at around 55%, and I have to restart the app to get back to the home screen. The premium keys aren't very easy to get as the only way is through completing floors, and it would be great if you could add the ability to add friends and private messages!"", ""I enjoy this game a lot, super cute and fun to play, I love the different themes :) Edit: As I level up, the chances are becoming too low, and collecting is difficult. I'm only level 15 - hope to see some tweaks in this area as the game has so much potential!"", ""It's basically the cat game, but with dogs! I've loved the cat game since my friend introduced me to it a few years ago, and when my sibling brought this to my attention I couldn't pass up the opportunity to play. Aside from minor stylistic changes it's the same; so it's perfect to play when I'm waiting on things to craft in the cat game (and vice versa) While it seems a little odd to have the same themes as paid for floors in the cat game be free in this one, that's really the only flaw imo"", ""Also having the black screen after the loading as others are reporting. A little disappointed that it's right in the middle of an event and more disappointed now that I may get auto-booted from my club before this gets fixed. I'm really trying to hang in there because I enjoy Cat Game so much, but it's getting very difficult."", ""An inferior version of Cat Game, which is a shame cause I really love the cute dogs as well. Crafting is such a nightmare though - both regular and events. It's not nearly as much of a slog to get through levels twice as high up as the ones in my little dog tower. Feels like they want you to spend money to move faster but nah. I'd get more for my money from their own other product."", ""Changed my rating. We had to get to like the 4th floor before we were able to quit the game and have it save. My son and I both downloaded this. Played it a bunch. I got to the second level with 2 dogs when I stopped playing. Next time I went into the game, all my progress was gone except the original dog that I picked. The same thing happened with my son.

Any idea why this is happening or how I can fix it? Thanks in advanced!"", ""Ever since the update I can't play the game. I LOVED playing it. The update has caused the game to no load.

Jigsaw Dating,"OVER 1 MILLION FACES REVEALED

We know you’re MORE than just your looks. So we puzzle your face and allow you to reveal your personality: message by message, piece by piece.

From the UK to the USA, our members have sworn off the shallow dating pool. By joining the deepest dating app on the App Store, people are sticking two middle fingers up to surface level judgement and small talk… and we’re just getting started.

Unlike hundreds of hot-or-not hookup apps, our community values kickass conversations, which ultimately lead to countless members finding a match that they love to pieces. 

YES… IT’S AN UNUSUAL CONCEPT

But let’s face it… The ‘usual’ apps only work for like 5% of people, so we had to think outside of the jigsaw box (hehe) for our solution.

Reveal what makes you ‘YOU’ with a profile that packs a punch, match with your admirers for all the right reasons, and kick-start exciting connections that begin with aligned intentions.

REVEAL THE REAL DEAL

Our #1 priority isn’t actually success stories (those are #2). Nothing matters more to us than your security, safety, and privacy.

Whether it’s our industry-first verification process, or the fact that profile reviews and reports are carefully handled by ACTUAL HUMANS, we don’t just rely on the natural anonymity that comes with Jigsaw. We want to be the safest (and the deepest) dating app in the universe.

I love the start up survey, but there seem to be a few tech issues.

Also, at some point I stopped getting message notifications. If you can look past these, it really is a great app.', ""I gave this app 2 stars because 1. The verification process was pretty simple and easy 2. Everything seems to be explained there's no guesswork. But this is where the app failed. 1 if you wanted to delete your account they give you no option 2. There is no option to select the age group that you would be interested in they selected for you 3. Same problem with choosing the location you have no option to select the location. Nice concept but these are the areas that need to be improved."", ""I'll start off by saying that I like Jigsaw. The concept is cute, and it is a nice way to encourage further conversations, but, I've had some issues wirh it. I tried to send likes people, but the only option was to message.

Dallas is a large city, there's no reason that there's suddenly no more matches for me to see."", ""Immediately jumps to asking me to pay and subscribe. I'm not interested in paying for any dating apps when they all look the same. Edit to add: developer asking me to pay for access without any evidence that this app is any different or better than others. Sounds like a short term cash grab, will be uninstalling ASAP"", ""Interesting and promising concept, but it needs improvement. Firstly, the messaging capability is SUPER glitchy. Doesn't refresh properly and when it does, it often repeats messages that were clearly only sent once. Also, the user base is saturated with people who don't seem to have grasped the concept and have blank bios. If the aim of the game is to get people talking based on common interests rather than superficial attraction, then a blank bio defeats the purpose. So... meh."", ""I like the idea. The puzzle is definitely a good ice breaker, but the chat is not reliable. Either it doesn't update, even after receiving a notification, or the messages are not sent and I have to retry multiple time. I'm on a good WiFi so definitely an app issue. Clearing the cache doesn't seem to help much. So good idea but the app needs strong improvements."", ""Like the idea of it and seems like a decent layout. However there are a couple glitches currently. Each time I go on the app it tells me to complete my profile even though it has been completed! As well as this, I've gotten a few notifications saying I have matches but when I go on the app, there's nothing. And it hadn't been 72 hours since the match.

I even sent off a message to developers to be sure I wasn\'t blacklisted or something and yeah ""we have new members joining everyday"" meh... almost a year and 👎🏼', 'Seems like a decent concept however there are a few basic features I\'d like to see implemented. One being the ability to filter out certain people based on absolute deal breakers such as kids and/or political affiliation. It would also make sense to be able to ""admire"" or comment on an ""About Me"" section. 3+ pics should be required from everyone on here as well as a filled out bio/prompts.

I can't even get the conversation started because it won't let me match with them, even if I'm interested."", ""EDIT: App works now!

A lot of the profiles are not give a location they are in just how many miles away they are."", 'Still a few bugs that need to be worked out, like when I click on ""admirers"" it crashes.

Most of the people I see are way too far away. Also, as the point of this is to match people based on personality, why are people allowed to not fill out their profile?

It's trying to gamify something that is already gamified, and so it's just a hat on a hat. People who wish to date based on info about the person and not looks are better off with OkCupid. At least you can go deep instead of basing your swipes on pithy responses to dumb prompts and hairlines."", ""Was good for about 3 days then now I can't get in.

No additional information nothing for me to make a decision on except for a jigsaw puzzle piece. Kind of defeats the purpose of trying to get to know someone before seeing what they look like.', ""It's an empty dating app. No search option but does have search settings which are inaccessible due to UI obstruction. Oh there's supposedly support via Facebook but they're unresponsive. I'm guessing someone started an app and got bored halfway through."", ""For the idea and concept I give it 5 stars, for the implementation I give it 1 star. 1) there is no way of knowing if a message has been sent, recieved or read. 2) spam accounts - there's lots of them, they tend to appear in batches in the same town/city. 3) considering it's a UK based company, there's very few people from the UK on the site. At best there seems to be a couple joining every week."", 'Was ok, had some nice chats. Then suddenly the app stopped registering messages correctly. Notifying me when there was nothing being shown and other parties messages at top of chat where as mine were all below.... update seems to have messed it all up. Tried contacting you guys and no response so deleted my account, why download something that is unusable', 'The app has lots of sketchy people actually looking for hookups... like everyone on here wanted to hook up. It was weird. I met someone who I thought was really awesome. We even talked on the phone for 2.5hrs! Then we met up at the arcade and his 3rd question for me was ""so why don\'t you hook up on the first date??"".... like sir, I do not know you and already told you no. This app may not be intended for hookups, but the people on it don\'t seem to know that 🙃😐', ""Given the developer replied ignoring the issue I'll review again, my issue isn't with the idea. It's fantastic. However your puzzling algorithm leaves little to he desired. It did not accept any selfies where my glasses were on and my hair was in any way covering my face. So in essence the only photos I could post had to be far enough away that it couldn't recognize my glasses being on and as a result hid my face and focused on my body....which is the actual problem with dating sites, not faces"", ""Good idea in theory, but thought by the ads it was supposed to be done kind of matchmaking thing. It blots out your face and hopes you'll match with someone. To me the face is more important than the body, and most backgrounds don't really portray who someone is. Looks aren't everything, but unless looks have zero meaning to you, choose an app you know who you're looking at, as this is the face you'll be looking at for sex, and for the rest of your life if you wanted to be serious."", ""I don't know what to say. I tried setting up a profile and none of my pictures with work because the app said it was out of bounds. But the frame they put around my face extended Beyond the picture. So I have to uninstall."", ""So far so good. I've only just got this app and its not that bad, just had issues with using most of my images for my face, my face was either to big? Or out of bounds this was very annoying. Also my name glitched, I have about three J's in my name and three e's which are all not there, now everyone thinks my name is JJeJesJess... Not even close... Good app just need to fix these glitches please, Many thanks"", ""I cannot complete my profile because it keeps closing out I sent in a ticket pertaining to the issue but I seriously doubt if anything will be done to fix it as I read someone else experienced the same issue at this point I'm just trying to delete what I have saved thus far and then the whole app"", 'Downloaded for a new experience. Went through maybe 7 options in a 50 mile radius around Orlando, FL and that was it. Half of those profiles had no profile just a single picture. I am not impressed.']",com.netsells.jigtalk,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netsells.jigtalk&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-23 13:20:26.093487,us,en

The lessons are easy, the mechanics of the app work very well with the lessons. I love the simple, straightforward format for the menu, as well. Prices are incredibly low as well, and there's a surprising amount of free lessons available from the get go. Love this app, hope maybe you can add more about addressing specific behaviors perhaps?"", 'This is an excellent app for training your dog new tricks. But, I gave 4 stars because there is a heavy emphasis on earning badges and there are no visual check marks on each completed item, which makes this feature lacking. I would like a better home screen with less clutter where I can upload a picture of my dog and have buttons to continue the lessons i left off.', 'I really enjoy this app! Only one I\'ve seen in a while where I want to buy the Pro and it\'s absolutely worth it. Well done on dog training explanations! Only reason it is 3 star instead of 5.. I can\'t open the ""circus"" trick jump through hoops arms without it erroring out ""cannot play video""... I never asked it to play video! Then the app freezes and I have to close it entirely.

I mean, the basic pack IS fine, but I feel like, my dog needs more things to learn... 3. I don't think the notification for training actually makes a sound. But other than that it's fine But I also have ideas pls send web"", ""The overall idea here is good. Although, they really need to do one of two things. 1. Make the clicker button centered and bigger or 2. Have a clicker only mode where clicking anywhere on the app will trigger the sound.

Hinge Dating App: Meet People,"<b>Find a date. Delete our app.</b>
Hinge is an inclusive dating app for people who want to get off dating apps for good. That means we’re for real people like you looking to chat, meet people, date and find relationship.
 
◼ 3 out of 4 people on Hinge want to go on a second date
◼ #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section
◼ Fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia
◼ Home of viral Voice Prompts
 
<b>Dating is hard. We try to make it a little less-hard.</b> ❤️‍🔥
The internet brings people and friends together, but we are here for those who want to meet people to fall in love with. Usually, digital dating puts matches before connecting, in person, where it counts. To change that, we built a dating app designed to be deleted. AKA, a dating app built to get you on actual dates with people who are more than us.
 
💌 We quickly learn your type and only introduce you to people we think would make a great date for you, increasing your chances to find love, not friends.
👋 Your answers to unique prompts help other people see beyond just a profile picture, making it easier to match, break the ice and start to chat and organize a date.
⭐ We get the conversation flowing - matches begin with a Like or Comment on a specific part of someone’s profile, giving the chat a smooth place to start and helps you assess chemistry. Could you be more than friends? Are they also looking for a relationship?
🔎 We actually check in to see how dates are going and follow up on how we can make better recommendations for future matches. We want you to fall in love and get off dating apps, not scroll through them forever.
 
<b>A dating app that is designed to be deleted</b>
🌐 We ask about religion, politics, future plans, etc. to help you share what is important to you even before starting a chat or meet someone on a date.
🌹 Roses kickstart potential matches, chats, dates, relationships and possibly love. 
🎯 Focused daily standouts help you meet the perfect match.
🔒 Our experience team is dedicated to maintaining a safe, inclusive space for online chats, offline dates, and connecting with people to fall in love with. 
🎙Voice prompts give you a better sense of people’s personalities off the app before meeting them on a date.
 
If you are tired of meeting people who only want to be friends, and want to power up your dating life, download Hinge. Our app is perfect for those ready to take a leap in the dating world. Whether you’re seeking love or to match and chat with new people, our features are designed to help you build a relationship that goes beyond just being friends.

So, $99 wasted."", ""so far I have some glitching and for the price, I don't like having the option of selectingb things with no history or not being able to find good matches after you select them, they go into some void... that is hindering possible connections and should not be happening in an expensive dating app... I've lost 3 profiles now, no way to find them, no way to see history, very dissappointing. won't be keeping this app, it's not worth the frustration of being teased with Good potential connections"", ""Pros : The user interface is decent, fresh and modern, combining text, pictures and polls in a clean way. I can't fault its design practices. Cons: I have spent 3 months on Hinge X. For this price point (circa £40 a month), you still have to pay extra for Boosts and sending Roses on top (be it they don't help). However. every single contact made in 3 months (literally) has been a scammer with fake photos/details, trying to sell me Trading Shares or Crypto and are never based where they claimed."", ""I like how the matching system works, that you match by picking something in the user's bio/promts and attaching a message, I don't like that they can be left blank though because it feels like you get solicited into writing a first message by half the matches, who do in fact leave it blank.

Of all the dating apps I\'ve tried, this is by far the worst one.', 'Hinge used to be the best dating app, but they tried to monetize it so hard that it\'s barely functional. They keep all the people that you might actually be compatible with behind the standouts or behind their premium features. Literally, if you click to see the benefits of premium, it says ""access to people more your type."" It\'s designed to be deleted bc you can\'t find anyone you\'re compatible with. The saving grace is its clean app design, though it can be glitchy too.', 'I\'ve used this app consistently for over a year, and then intermittently thereafter. They make you pay, in some additional way, for the ""more attractive"" people to match with, and their ""compatible"" suggestions are not the best either. Just as waste of time and money thus far. Whatever algorithm they use for matches, and suggestions, needs a MAJOR overhaul... unless it\'s intentional. In that case, it\'s still not smart because people, esp nowadays, will get tired and move on to other apps.', ""Only four photos are showing up instead of six. Really annoying bug; I assume it's a bug because six photos are still required to make a profile, which wouldn't make sense if only four will be displayed.

Only 4 photos showing up is really annoying, it doesn't let me see enough photos!! Lots of random bugs, and the push for monetization is awful.

You text someone, even give some good effort and send fun and witty messages and they stop messaging like instantly. Waste of time.', 'I\'m only giving a low rating to try to bring awareness of the only gripe I have with this app. It would be really nice if the ""review skipped profiles"" option wasn\'t directly below the ""change preference"" button.

Please change this!', 'Update: After getting through the initial bugs, technical issues are less frequent. Still a few annoying bugs though. The main redeeming factor is that I\'m getting lots of great matches, which obviously is the most important thing. Original: So far so bad.

Also no simple way to just have a short bio or list some interests. Gonna try to get a refund.', ""I really wanted to like Hinge. I feel that it's easily one of the best at removing scammers and fake profiles. Voice prompts are a unique feature and give you a better picture of a potential match. The problem is that there's just no activity. I've been using the paid version of this for months and haven't had a single date. Only a handful of people even match and of those only a small percentage bother to reply back.

The only negatives I had were scam attempts. It does try to get you to buy stuff, but it isn't mandatory like Bumble and others.

I rarely see ""standouts"" on my discover page. If they are catered to me because we have the same interests then why are they not on discover? You only get one rose a week and you put the hot women on standout in order to monetize off of them. That\'s pretty sketchy to me.

Total WASTE OF TIME!', ""Best part about it is the voice message feature. I think I am the only member who uses the video recording profile feature. Honestly, though, I would remove the requirement to have all three prompts in a profile. And the service shouldn't be paid.

Hinge is where all the cute women are, until they give up and try another app."", ""The free version is useless. You can't search or filter. They present you with one profile at a time .99% of them are not what you're looking for. Age range of profiles I've been given are 18-62!

It's ridiculous."", ""Pros: Great layout and Voice prompts are cool. Fun commercials. No ads. Cons: Limited likes, constantly showing people out of state, the membership price is ludicrous, the benefits of memberships are base features for a lot of dating apps.

Just starting out on dating apps and thought since it was free a good place to start. Easy to install but keeps showing me men who are gay, bi, or super far away. Changed my distance setting and the men are still the same. Not sure if it would be different if I had a subscription, but I feel that really shouldn't matter. Will probably delete in a few days if it is no better"", ""This app has many issues, with the primary being the massive paywall. I have a + subscription, because dating apps tend to be a numbers game. However...most of the people I'd be interested in are standouts.

Only thing are the glitches! For example, I really liked someone's profile.

These things are really frustrating when they happen. Please look into it."", 'The most compatible only shows people for me that I have absolutely zero interest in.

It is difficult to use, especially if you want to book a service but you are not at home at the moment you are looking. The app picks up the location you're at at the moment and finds dog sitters in an area you don't want. It's not responsive when trying to adjust location.

And you don't always want to book it until you meet the client. So it's a mess, for 20% fee there should be a better user experience. When you select to give feedback the app directs you to FAQs page which makes it seem like Rover is uninterested in improvement of the app. There needs to be more options. And directing to decline a booking but not having the option isn't helpful."", ""Overall it's pretty good in terms of functionality and has been very helpful when we need a cat sitter. But I'm disappointed by the fact that Rover could SO easily be better for cat people, for example, by allowing us to search for sitters who specialize in and/or prefer cat care. I get that it's primarily for dogs, but they're just throwing money away by not adding simple features that would make it much better for those with cats."", ""This is one of the worst apps I've ever used. The APP UI search is useless at best, the web UI shows much more results that don't even appear on mobile. No easy way to share a profile outside of the app for someone else (my wife to look at in her app).  Outside of those issues, the people problem is the worst,  people list they are available all day at home and show their calendar as available, Then you send a request and they say they work 8-4. Or they are only free after 1pm. Or they are busy that day. I get they are trying to make it convenient for them by showing a high availability but that defeats the whole purpose of a calendar.   Being a new customer and hearing great things about this service, I am completely disappointed."", ""Previous Rover customer, I downloaded the app bc I thought it would be easier to use on my phone than the website but it's NOT. The search function is a mess. I couldn't search by zip (even though the app said I could) and I couldn't sort the search results at all (by price, distance, etc). The distance estimates were extremely inaccurate and most of the results were 10+ miles away. When I search on the site I found many sitters within 5 miles, including the last sitters I used who were great."", ""Great for making connections between pet owners & sitters. However, the app falls short in MANY areas, as a lot of the reviews point out. My phone shows 1.99 GB user data for this app. That's an incredible amount. I was told there's no way to delete pics/ videos of past sits that I also saved to my profile. It was suggested I clear storage, but what about the things I would like to keep? So many other simple things you just cannot do in this app. Development of it was/is a very low priority."", ""I don't usually leave reviews but this one is needed. I HATE this app. It used to be good, but lately I can't do a thing with it. If I bring it up, it refuses to load my dashboard, visits or anything which is a MAJOR problem when I'm trying to start my drop-ins for clients. The only time it seems to work decently is when I'm connected to wi-fi...AT MY OWN HOME. It won't work on cellular networks. What use is that when I need the app at a client's house without wi-fi?!"", ""What's up with your app lately?? I have been using Rover for many years and it has provided additional income which I love. I generally have no complaints and have never had a bad experience. However the app is driving me nuts this past week. Won't let me open the drop in cards so I have to reinstall every time I do a drop in. It doesn't save any of the water/food features.

I moved and changed my address, but additionally needed to change my location. Which doesn't make sense. Also, when I tried to edit my profile, text boxes blocked the prompts I was supposed to answer so I couldn't see the questions. Service is great, customer support is great, but the app itself is not user friendly."", 'Until recently, the app worked really well! I could communicate with clients, update my calendar, manage bookings, edit my profile, etc. Now when I open the app it immediately goes to the page to search for a sitter. There seems to be no way for me to manage my own profile, bookings, etc. on the app now, meaning I have to use the website if I want to get anything done. It is frustrating to say the least. Please fix this, Rover!', ""I have had exceptional experiences using Rover. I love the set up for finding a sitter, booking, having contact with the individual as well as the notification that the sitter has checked in. Additionally the payment system is easy to use. The only issue I have is that I can only customize the tip to a certain percent of the total cost. I wanted to tip a specific dollar amount which was over that. Otherwise it's great and I plan to keep utilizing this service."", ""First off, I've been a sitter for over 3 years on Rover and have worked around the bugs this whole time. However, the updated layout on the app is not working properly. It says I have a message from the client but it only shows the days and time they selected and not the message they typed. I had to log on to a web browser to see the message. Its still not populating the conversation on the app."", ""The app is fine, except I HATE the new calendar update for the app. Like, it's seriously bad compared to what it used to be. The other one was pretty straightforward, and this one sucks at editing multiple days, takes longer to load the days, and overall doesn't look nice. The only thing I like are the color coded days. Please revert back to the old calendar, keeping color coded days. I hate having to go to the desktop to edit when the app is right there, with a useless calendar."", ""As a sitter this was a very easy to use app with minimal interface issues. However I suppose in a recent update, they have changed how to set your calendar and even single dates in general. It's so much more difficult and cumbersome as I now have to go through every single day to set up availability on certain services rather than simply highlight a group of dates (say for a week or a month) and edit availability on each service I provide. I don't know why the horrible new change."", ""It's overall a decent app but in a couple places the UX flow is all wrong. I should be able to return to the search after contacting a sitter so I can contact others in case the first isn't available. Better yet, I should be able to send the times I selected and a generic message to several sitters at once. Also, some sitters will have a notice on their profile that they are either fully booked or not available at one of the times.

The only things I noticed, are the adds get too frequent the longer you play it, and it is hard to control the dogs on the obstacle course. Just remember game developers, the more adds there is, the more irritating it gets for people, and the more it takes the joy out of the game. Knowone wants to see adds that much."", ""I loved this game as a kid, so running across it again, I decided it may be fun to download it. But it's so glitchy now. I haven't been in game for more than an hour and it's getting annoying. I can't play with them the dogs in my yard. It won't let me click on them, or even call them back inside. Once they're outside, the buttons all grey out. I also can't pet them usually, for some reason? The hitboxes seem kind of weird, I guess. And they also take some weird turns and clip sometimes."", ""This game is very addicting. I highly reccomend this game to people who love animals. Even though there are only dogs, it's still fine. Sometimes the dogs and frisbees go through the fence.. but I get it cause' it's hard to animate and plus that's def better then I would do. Also the graphics are really good and the dogs are so cute! I love how you need to actually like train the dogs and I love how every single dog has some different problem. I love the game! 😊😃"", ""You cannot escape the ads. Every time you complete an action in plays an ad. I gave this game a chance and played until level five but I could not get over how many ads there were.

Too repetitive and boring."", ""My game malfunctions a lot the dust pan and brush froze in place and my game crashed. and I checked which level I had to open the next kennel and the thing froze and I had to restart the game and every thing froze.

Thx"", ""Limited gameplay, just doing the same few things with every dog. Also the exersize activity is very broken it does not pick up half the strokes I do and misses the obstacle all the time.

Overall ok but not a game I see myself keeping due to the gameplay being broke at times."", ""Please fix this game. The dogs just hit the walls, never stop moving, are constantly trying to turn around and don't do anything, and on the obstacle course, the dog just spins in circles and never finishes.

I use the same tricks on my dog and it works. I honestly recommend this game and it only works in your Wi-Fi so yeah there is a lot of ads but it's so good.

I don't think the green/yellow dot is that accurate."", ""I like the concept and seems like it would be good if not for a few things. The new compatibility only works if the matches have also done their new quizzes. You really need to pay for the subscription to make the app useful at all.

Once you buy a subscription you're locked in and can't cancel/stop payments unless you live in a specific state. In LESS than 24 hours of subscribing I knew it wasn't the right app for me and they won't let me cancel. In my opinion, you can get better matches, profiles, and services on other platforms for free/half the cost."", ""So frustrating.

The premise is interesting on paper with psych profiles and compatibility ratings. In practice however, even in very large cities, the userbase just doesn't compare to more modern dating apps. Among the millions of users advertised, a significant portion have not been active in the last month. Add in an outdated user interface, and an unjustifiably high subscription cost... It's not worth it"", ""If I could leave zero stars I would. Got sucked into wanting to see the pictures that were blurred out for free version. Now paying for 6 months of junk.

However, it is the most expensive dating site I've ever used, requires you to sign up for long term commitments, and most of the good profile matches seem to be with dead profiles (people that tried it and no longer use it)...so it's a complete waste of money. I will definitely not be renewing."", ""This app/site on general is pretty much dead at this point. The interface isn't horrible, but pretty much every other aspect of the experience is. I don't know what else to add other than what everyone else has already mentioned.

The matching system is interesting and thorough but it's poorly explained and it really doesn't seem to match on anything but personality. Interests, lifestyle, and life goals don't seem to come into play and there's such a limited number of potential contacts that it's a bit disappointing. The cost is ridiculous and canceling won't stop the billing till the term is up. I highly recommend Bumble as a better option for dating."", ""While the app itself looks promising, It was a major let down. First problis the test they have you fill out that once completed can't be redone. So you have a good chance of lowering your possible matches at the start. I don't have enough space to review all the issues but the next one is the worst. A very expensive membership that requires a minimum signup of 6 months. I filled out my search filters and after paying and filling out everything. NO people were shown to me. Terrible app."", 'This app has been a pain from the start. You basically cant do anything without a subscription. Their payment options for subscriptions are absolutely outrageous. You can either pay a ridiculous amount month-to-month compared to other dating sites or do a 6-month payment plan at a heavy discount. And you cant do any of that on the app. It all has to be done on their website. Same with canceling your plans or deleting your account. Now Im stuck with a profile for 4 months till my sub ends.', ""This service is a joke.... Make sure to read the other reviews!! 90% of profiles have no pictures (or are inactive), with preferences set to 60mi and a 10 year age range there's barely any profiles that do actually have pictures even though I live <30 miles from Boston. Not to mention getting stuck paying the subscription if you choose an extended subscription even if you don't want it after a month considering it's such trash.."", ""Disappointing. Much too pricey for the lack of features provided. Filtering is virtually non-existent. The app is very basic. And I strongly suspect that I'm not being shown all of the people in my area even though I have pretty broad criteria. Another site that leans on visuals, the profile section is much too short for me to evaluate match potential even when someone bothers to complete it. Expensive lesson learned."", ""App is a scam, the time it takes to make a profile they don't warn you that the whole thing after will be payment based and you won't even be able to send messages without paying.

I sent a message, but there was no response . No profile delete buttons."", ""For an app thats been around as long as eHarmony I expected them to get better in time at helping people find each other.

This time around they've removed (or not included) the ability to filter by drinking habits, Christian denomination, last login, profile update, or whether the profile has a picture many of these were in the last version of the app / site... Lame. Also, the pricing model is just totally bonkers."", ""Super restricted if you're bot a premium member (can only choose state, not a max range from your city, can't filter search results at all). But honestly, the stupidest thing, you can't view photos if you're not premium. Automatic pass. Not even going to consider paying if I can't even truly look at a profile. Like most dating sites/apps, you have tons of bare profiles minus pictures, so hiding them makes zero sense."", ""The app looks good, but you can't do anything on it without upgrading your account to Premium. Currently, the shortest membership is 6 months for $120. One feature hidden behind the paywall that really shouldn't be is the ability to see how many users are in your area. It's hard to justify the purchase without knowing if there anyone in your area is actually using it. The closest profile to me that I found is over 250 miles away."", ""Crashes Continuously - I mean if you are going to pay for a service at least have it work. Notifications are random. Some times you get them sometimes you don't. Only way to really match with people is if you search the whole US. Half the profiles don't have a picture so it's kind of weird. Also they don't have to actually answer any of the profile questions so most are super bland. I just expected more."", ""The service itself isn't a bad option, it's one of the first sites I tried, and liked it years ago. Coming back to it, I'd say about 80% of the matches I get seem to be inactive profiles, that never respond to attempts to contact them, which is frustrating given the fact that this is one of the more costly online dating services. Furthermore, the app is very slow and buggy most of the time, taking 30 seconds or more to load each match you click on. And timing out when you send a message or a smile to a match. It's very prohibitive, and as a result, I often don't review matches for days or weeks, or finally just is the mobile site instead of the app. Seems like eH has a lot of areas in which they can improve. And, at this point, I'd be more likely to recommend a number of other services before this one for people looking for an all around quality online dating experience."", 'This app/site has so many issues.

Majority are hits and still somehow have somewhat different plot setups which is refreshing. I really loved the playfulness of this one and I loved it, up until the climax of the plot (before you pick your partner). That felt rushed to me, for some reason. However, I loved the change in the end where you get to pick your comfort level with the guy you picked. Like if you wanted to go all the way that night or ""go slow"", you decided. ❤️', ""It's great, very cute story and easy to follow, I personally enjoyed it but I didn't really like the little mini game to earn points, most of the time it only gives my 2 points and it doesn't go any higher than that, the mini game also tends to get boring, I would suggest to put one or two more mini games to make it more fun, other than that I think this app is great :)"", 'I really loved the story and the plot! It was just that it upset me knowing that i was out of tickets to get to the next story. Diamonds are easy to get, comparing to other similar games.I really apprecciate the time and effort that the creators/developers put into this game! I really recommend it if you are looking for a love story!', ""The storyline and characters are great!!! The only problem I have is that we cant play minigames in between episodes and when we need to make choices. It's a little annoying having to stop the story to play the minigame but other than that, everything is perfect!"", ""I literally love this but more choices leading up to different routes would be good too , and if you create a point system about the main character's past choices or w/ other characters would be good. I would recommend that. Mostly just more choices to choose from that aren't charging rubies:) overall great app"", ""Omg, this game is INTENSE! And so are the boys (mainly Dobe) I really hated the fact that I have to wait 4 hours to get points or play one mini-game 100 times (more or less). Also, I'm kinda disappointed over the fact that you can't design your character besides the name. Overall though, I really enjoyed it."", 'I liked the story. the graphics are good. And i really enjoyed it. The reason i didnt put 5 star is bc 1. It was slightly fast paced with there meeting and such. its all based over a few months the first month passing fast. 2. the most important one is the rubies. BE PREPARED TO EITHER SPEND MONEY OR LOTS OF TIME! I didnt take two stars away be they do give u a trading system to get rubies and tickets for apps and actions. But very pricey and each choice is around 25 rubies. I did trade system.', ""Love the different options available. My only problem was the spinning for coins. The option for choosing to watch a video is always no videos available. What an inconvenience! If u don't want ur gamers to watch the video then don't put the choice up..."", ""I love this game! The only thing is that the rubies are so expensive to get if you run out,and the mini game isn't that good either, for example, if you have 3 green hearts that aren't in a line you should still win some ponts but over that the game is awseome. I highly reccomend it with other Genius inc. Games."", ""I've played a lot of apps by this company, and this one is probably my least favorite so far. Totally putting aside art, there was no time to actually bond with the characters. This one was really short compared to others I've played, and while I usually do get attached to characters, these guys felt like buddies or siblings, definitely not partners/potential partners."", 'Its not worth it. Frequent ad popups randomly when navigating menus. You can either pay money for Rubies in order to get the premium scenes, or earn points by watching an ad once every 4 hours, or getting lucky in a slot machine game and watch more ads to triple the point payout. You can then exchange points for rubies. The price for rubies is steep. I tried to dismiss the ""buy rubies"" menu but accidentally bought some without meaning too. I was charged a $35 dollar overdraft because of it.', 'I am just so in love with this app! Cute, adorable dogs, hot guys with the nicest and unique personalites in one and there are 3 of them!

The app is easy to use and not overly complicated. I was literally blushing the whole time❤❤❤❤ love this app!', ""This game is soo fun. I absolutely love it and I'm so addicted to it but I only have two complains. 1: why are gems so expensive 😭😭😭 please give us a way to earn them or something. 2: can't you make the ticket wait a little shorter please 🙄🙄. But at the end of the day really great game I highly recommend it to anyone, especially people with unlimited data and some money. 😂😂😁"", ""There are no technical issues, very few grammer mistakes but I can't help but feel the storylines and the love interests have a repitive pattern.

You need to explore different personalities for both MC and love interests and you need to come up with unique storylines."", ""I love this game and I'm not even done playing through it. The characters are all so handsome and sweet and they never fail to surprise me with new parts of their personality. When Bernar said he loved me, I literally erupted in giggles.

I gave it three stars because of the gems, sometimes you end up saying something a bit rude or weird because you dont have enough gems. also the minigame! please add another one ^^ it gets a bit boring after a while overall, its a nice, sure the gems bother me a bit, but i like it!', ""I love this game so much. They are all adorable, but it's stupid when I want to earn points to exchange for diamonds. I downloaded 2 games to download and run and it said it would give me 30 or 40 points and then it said we don't have this on the list anymore! So I have to pay for it instead of exchanging!!

Sometimes, you can answer kinda rudely, but if you really really like that person, and don't have enough gems, there's just no feel for the story! Please please please make the gems no more! Or at least refill the gems everyday or something. All I want is to enjoy a good story, and you're giving me one: but you're also taking all the fun out of it!"", ""I really like this game. It's a good story to follow along with. You don't get many gems or tickets but I think it's worth the wait. I found out I could divide my time to play it in the morning, the middle of the day, and at night so I could get more tickets and watch ads to get more coins for gems. I definitely recommend it, even my friend likes it"", 'I love the story it\'s taken me more than 6 months of watching videos and playing the mini game once a day but I loved this app only reason I\'m uninstalling it is because I finished all routes and endings.

I really hated wasting my gems tho since it's really hard to get gems in the game when you spend them but overall i really liked the plot of the story and the twist in the end! I hope to see more stories like these in the end! :D"", ""I am absolutely hooked to your games like this, but i have a suggestion, i noticed all of the characters are so pale skinned, would you be willing to add some color to their features besides their hair? In starlit proposes, the one with purple hair (i forgot his name) he's actually tanned.... I just thought you needed more like that. Other then that, I'm good."", ""I love the theme song! I was skeptical but Im glad I tried it. Never knew lowkey beastiality could be this sweet. Reminded me a lot of 'Heart of Fox'. The only issue I had with the game was that the story was hastily done in the end. Why were the delinquents vandalizing the shop? What happened to the rival shop? Also I was sure than Cain had something to with it since he was the only one who knew we were out, that route would've slapped. Hes involved. Theres tension. Build up. We bust him.

This game is on piont"", ""I love this game, I've also realised that Dobe and Bernar literally share my personality, so yeah, I love this game, it's one of my favourite games of all time, you have mad it really hard for me to chose between Dobe and Bernar though, but I love a challenge in a relationship,or even just picking one"", ""The main issue for me is that some of the LIs look underage. If the player is underage, there is no issue. For those players who aren't underage, there is only one LI to choose from. That is just my personal, subjective opinion.

Every action you take gets an ad and the interface is similar to those websites that have 30 download now buttons trying to get you to download a virus. The TikTok ad is app-breaking. It is unskippable with no X to click. Even opening it still takes you back to the ad. There's no way around it but to exit the app. I did manage to get one picture in and it identified the breed incorrectly. Why would they think we'd pay for a pro version? 0/5. ;("", ""I got the perfect shot and it correctly identified the dachshund in my dog. It all just depends on the perfect shot (all you have to do is just take a side picture of your dog looking at you helps). It just should lower the analysis time and have a better accuracy when people take pictures of the owners dogs. But I love it even if they didn't do that."", ""1-27-21 App problems have been fixed. Great job! Update 9/27/20-Developer updated app. When scanning photo(s) from gallery the app no longer works properly but constantly flips back into camera mode. Unfortunate. From 5 to 1 star and deleting app. Will check back periodically to see if it's fixed. 7/31/20-So far, a truly wonderful and innovative app. I'm really enjoying it."", ""Fun and pretty accurate readings based on a photo, or many different photos together to cover all bases. It was right on on my dogs and has a lot of info on specific breeds. I scanned many different photos of my dogs and it gave me the right answer with details on breed, or breeds. Very cool and fun. I was glued for over an hour playing around with this app. I don't think I'll delete it yet."", ""The app itself is not bad as a bit of fun, although suspect it isn't very accurate with mixed breeds. The number of ads makes it unusable though, as there seems to be one every 20 seconds and if you close one of the small ads, a full page one immediately appears. I may have purchased the ad free version if I had a chance to try the app for a bit longer, but am not prepared to watch that many ads just to decide if I like it."", ""actually surprised me! sometimes it fails to identify a common breed but then somehow it manages to CORRECTLY dentify random cross breeds. obviously the picture will play a part in how accurate the results are, but even a perfect pic might not get the right result cuz obviously identifying a breed by a pic alone isn't an exact science and one dogs can look like one think but be 100% proven to be something completely different, appearances can be misleading. cool app though"", ""I would definitely recommend this app. Out of all of the apps I tried, this one was bang on identifying a 4 week old puppy we rescued. the accuracy isn't 100% but pretty damn close. For anyone using this app, make sure you use more than one picture to see how many times it recognizes a specific breed, and then do your research. This is a great app to use to give you a lead on a breed, and the rest is up to you."", ""Not sure to give it 2 or 3 stars. They did well to get 1m downloads so respect for that because it's main functionality which is the scan is average at best. They even openly admit on the app that the top 1 accuracy is 71%. This is a pretty bad result. If you like bells and whistles then this app is for you. If you would like to get proper identification - there are better apps around."", ""This isn't a bad app at all. I've only used it for about four of my assorted mongrels so far, but it knew my hairy Bulgarian dog was a mix of various Eastern European shepherds. I don't know her origins, but the dogs it suggested seemed pretty close. Plausible enough for passing curiosity, anyway. I wouldn't want to settle an argument with it, but it's a bit of fun."", ""Its something different and some what funny. But very unreliable. So unreliable that I am willing to bet it get's the dog breed every time unless ypu owm a pure bred. Again I am not hating the app or developers. Hopefully they can creat default ways to take pictures this way it is more accurate. Especially when considering am entire skeletal structure in a picture."", ""the free version is nearly impossible to use bc the amount of ads. I mean, I've never seen anything like it. Waaaaaaaayyyy too many ads. pretty much every 3 click activates the same Temu ad for a washing machine 🫤"", ""I love it! I've been waiting to find something like this for years It's pretty spot on. I think it's cool that it can recognize mix breeds. I can't say for sure how accurate it is because my dogs are a mix of at least 2 but probably 3 or 4 different breeds, but the app results agree almost perfectly with our best guesses for both dogs, so i think it's great."", 'Absolutely awesome and how do you do it? I was very easily able to scan several dogs in our family (must sit still 5 seconds) with the app. The answer is perfect especially for Heinz 57 and somewhat mixed breeds. It gives a breakdown in percentages with sample photos to support their analysis. Suggest you take a FULL profile scan and not facial close up. Highly recommend this app!!!', ""Pretty cool app. Just wanted ideas of what my dog could be mixed with as she looks like a larger version of a heeler. The only negative is the intensity of the ads. I'm fine with free apps showing ad banners, or occasionally a short ad, but press ANY button and you're stuck with a 30s ad video AND the post-ad promotional poster that makes you wait to press the 'x'. Good for a one time use it if you have patience, or probably if you pay"", ""I kept being interrupted by ads, and when I finally reached Dog Scan, there was nothing...NOTHING to show me how to use it!!!. It also crashed 3 times while I was on there. Don't bother with this app, its annoying and VERY frustrating!!!😡😡😡"", 'If you give it a reasonable photograph, it does seem to come up with reasonable matches. I tested three mixed breed adult dogs of unknown origin, but from the same litter. One of the three looks different from the other two. The app gave me the same sorts of answers for each dog. Dutch shepherd. I tested multiple photographs. The variation was not as great as I expected it to be.', ""It's a good idea, but it's not accurate; It seems like developers are on the right path as far as using images submitted and asking users to correct what breed the scanned dog actually is for future recognition abilities of this app.... but it has never been right :/ I tried multiple dogs that I know."", ""Could be useful to rescue groups and shelters. Best results when using a full view picture without much else in the photo. Not useful for some mixed breeds. Others have provided good feedback. I've tested some shelter dogs, comparing their guess to the tool suggestion. Many times I've agreed with the app over the shelter guess."", ""The app is pretty good so far. The only time I can say for a fact it was wrong was when I scanned my rat terrier. She's a runt and sickly, so she looks more like a chihuahua. It scanned her as that, but it's a common mistake, so not one that surprised me. Aside from that, it gave me good insight on what my other dogs might be. Only issue is that the video ads can be intrusive. Went from one every 10min to 3 in a minute."", 'I have 2 poodles. One everyone thinks is not a poodle due to the texture of her hair. The scanner guessed both breeds correctly. I see complaints about the ads but it comes with the territory of a free app. Stop complaining or pay for the premium version.', ""Dogs don't like loud sudden ad sounds in their face while getting a photo taken. These adds are full-screen and can't be backed out of. Unexpected startling ad sounds is not too smart for a pet friendly app."", ""I had an incredibly loud and intrusive ad and it had no obvious X or mute, pressing what looked like an escape route forcefully opened my app store, once I went back to the app, the advertisement was still stuck on my screen, now it had an X and I pressed it, but it took me right back to the store again. Double kill. I don't think I trust this app and I'm deleting this immediately, it couldn't correctly identify my dog either."", ""This app is pretty cool not to sure how accurate these kind really are. I took a picture of one of our dogs and got my friend in the picture and it kind of confused the app so it gave me an idea to take a picture just of my friend & the result was partly correct when it said human the very funny thing was it said the larger percentage was Great Dane. We laughed so hard. I still smile when I think about it. They do say sometimes we tend to resemble each other-thing is we don't have a Great Dane."", 'I have three foster puppies from the same litter, all were totally different. Also, took different pictures with same outcome. Different breed, every time.  Also took another picture of my dog (we had a dna test on him) again with different results that were completely different. It’s a good thing the app is free.', ""It doesn't seem very accurate because I scanned my dog at three different angles and I got three different results and two of the same angle and two different results and not one of the breeds, out of all the five times I got results, did any of the results have one of the same as the others. So I couldn't even get a good guestimate."", 'I was impressed. scanner is most impressive. was able to get clear and focused images of dog scanned dog three times and he was identified as the same breed each time and the percent of account increased each time until 98%. Yes GREAT APP. 👍', ""It's so cute! But besides that, it's fairly accurate so long as you do several photos from different angles. Sometimes depending on the features that certain breeds have, a weird angle could change the entire results."", 'Great fun! Used this app on my ""pavement special"" rescued dogs and came up with some interesting results. Not that accurate, but I won\'t hold that against this app as dogs can be difficult to identify, especially if they are bouncing around when you try to scan them - something the app manages to do well. Like I said great fun, informative on breeds and I enjoy using it.', ""The app has been correct. I clicked incorrect on one of them because the husky breed was off but that's not a surprise because the breeds are so closely linked. a second scan of the same dog with body without the face came up with the closer mix. I'm very impressed and happy with the results. I also love the info that comes with the breed."", 'As someone else said it\'s good for entertainment value. App said my purebred Mastiff (rescued retired breeder) was Mixed breed and gave FOUR different breeds, most of them pretty off. Apparently my other 2 rescues are both Australian Kelpies, one of them a purebred - don\'t think so. [EDIT: have to eat my words - I searched black/tan kelpies and my ""purebred"" rly matches the look!] Using the app was nice enough (except for the ad every single time). It just doesn\'t have superb accuracy. Yet?', ""it's kinda fun. I'm not sure I would pay for the app but it's fun to scan my dogs and see what it comes up with. I believe it scans the dog then runs the photo through its database of pictures and compares it to them. it pulls out the ones that look most like the dog depending on the angle of the scan you did. The first scan I did of my 3mth old puppy seemed pretty accurate. I will be trying my other dogs too. It also has a cat scanner option."", ""I've only just downloaded this, but it correctly figured out the breeds of all three of my dogs, even from images where they weren't facing the camera, and figured out that my cat was, in fact, a cat when I tried to trick it. Now, none of those would be hard for a human to figure out, but I am genuinely impressed an app could manage it."", '4 and a half stars Nifty little app. I love animals, especially dogs, so I can defnitely see how having dog scanner will come in handy. Whenever hanging out with family and/or friends you can turn it into a fun game. Knowing dogs as well as I do I can see myself winning a lot, lol. Not only do you have the fun factor of playing a game, its an educational tool as well.', ""Love, LOVE, L-O-V-E this app. and, I haven't even had it for 24 hours! I have been using a similar app, for several months. Yet, so far, Dog Scanner is, Leaps & Bounds above the competition. I mean, you guys are...KILLING IT! Period. I purchased the premium version of Dog Scanner. Main reason was to eliminate Ads. (Thanks, Ads-No-More). I was, also, impressed by the amount of, factually accurate, breed specific info (contained-within-the app.) Kudos-to-You, Dog Scanner. Your product ROCKS!😋🙃😜"", ""This app is interesting, and insightful. I've only tried it with my dog, which was an unknown mix of breeds until I used this app. Very fun and surprisingly accurate for how many poor angles and lightnings I used in the pictures. The ads in app are very small and do not get in the way of using the app (thank you!!)"", ""I tried 4 different photos of the same dog, all clear pictures that included his face. (The dog is a stray mutt that showed up.) Results varied widely. Side views of the head seemed to work best. It doesn't work that great with mixes, but is still helpful in that it can suggest possible breeds present in the ancestry of your mutt. Then you can google those breeds specifically to see more pictures. Easier than combing thru photos online, but not as good as asking your vet, is my opinion."", 'Just downloaded the app, from one I saw so far it seems excellent. Obviously ads all the time....normal. What I would like to see is improvement on detailed info..like weight range and longevity. For me this seems like an excellent app for people who see a dog they like and interested in getting one, so providing this kind of information would bring greater interest in your app.', ""Awful app. Ads whenever you press anything, can't figure out how to close the ads, cluttered and too complicated. Waste of time."", ""Highly Accurate - Don't listen to the naysayers. Often times when people get inaccurate results, they are using a bad picture with bad lighting. This app has accurately identified over 100+ breeds as I volunteer at an animal shelter and have used it to identify both purebred and mixed dogs. Whenever it got the breed wrong, changing the angle of the pic, adding better lighting and finessing the overall picture - resulted in a correct identification of the mutt at hand. Enjoy! A great app indeed!!"", 'Really cool idea for an app. One thing that would make the results higher quality would be to allow users to upload multiple photos from different positions, then run each photo through the service and average the results.']",com.siwalusoftware.dogscanner,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siwalusoftware.dogscanner&hl=en&gl=us,2023-08-23 13:21:03.287560,us,en

The biggest issue is that there are absolutely nobody on here. Even in a major Metroplex there is no one on here outside of the occasional working girl. I can log in at any point and there be nothing. No one is interested in this app and quite frankly it's but one of many trying to prey on men trying to get their rocks off."", 'EDITED IN RESPONSE TO DEV COMMENT: I appreciate the response; I should have been more clear with what I was referring to with my initial review.. Yes, you *can* set the distance filter but the results do not correspond with whatever you set for. I put ""less than 40 miles"" or something and yet literally ALL of the profiles and matches I get shown are anywhere from 80 or 90 to even several hundreds of miles. So my issue is that the distance filter seems to do little to nothing in practice.', ""The most useless dating app ever!. They charged me over $30 for the month and yet I see ZERO candidates or matches, the search page is blank and saying to change the filter or preferences. I only have set a few important to me.

Two matches one initially England and then after the message usa, second also England and after first message norther Ireland.

I had to set the setting for distance to 200 miles away and there obviously more people to see, that are closer but then your limited on how many people you can like.

Anytime a service won't let you confirm it has active local users then it's because they don't. What's worse is these kinds of tactics are exactly why they don't attract enough users.

I wanted a whistle for our dog. & Even did not work. LOL There are different frequencies that maybe I don't know enough about, but she never responded to those either.
