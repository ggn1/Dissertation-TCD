Here's some ideas I have to make the game a little more interesting, I want to see the upstairs of the house, more breeds, more customization with the breeds, and being able to customize the house. That's all of the ideas i have pls make a few or more possible! The game would be so much better if you did!"", 'I love it but it does need a update here are some ideas -more skins -new map -events like in wildcraft -chest to get skins I would love to have some of that in the game', ""The game is good it works fine for me on single player but when I switch to multiplayer it kinda lags alot idk if it's just my device"", ""I love this game but since the updates it's not really fun anymore because there is no free coins anymore and I love getting free coins to see more games"", 'This is a very amazing game I like it very much the only problem I have sometimes the mate have got stuck.', ""I would give you a 5 star rating it's just the game is a bit sloppy....we need more dog colours and dog breeds And even more places and it needs to be more realistic.And a easier way of getting quest done it takes me forever to get some done and I want to be able to collect things like a collar and I want owners thank for the game hope you can fix this:)!!!!!"", ""I enjoy it, it's fun. It gets annoying and boring after a while though. Some of the tasks are hard to take care of. It might ask me to attack 3 humans but I'll end up only finding 2 out of the whole map. My dogs constantly get stuck behind something. Oftentimes they phase through whatever is holding them back and they cant go around the obstacle at all bc they're literally inside it. I mostly play the game because one of the dogs looks EXACTLY like my black mouth Cur <3 that's the only reason"", ""It's not a bad game but it does seem annoying when it comes to the ads in every single gameplay. The varieties of dogs to buy is kinda interesting yet you always have to grind for coins, which takes forever to get more. Even the quest are slow, why do we have to take an hour or so for a quest to pop up? It's agonizing just to wait for a few hours till you get a quest and then after completing it. ANOTHER couple MORE hours for it to load, SERIOUSLY!? It's ridiculously pointless just to wait...-_-"", ""I love this dog game! The only bad thing is that there is no way to doge a hunters attack and the music is kind of weird and also I don't like where people are shooting dogs it feels wrong and also you can make the houses a little bit more realistic and be able to go in them"", ""I'm my opinion this is a decent game. There's lots of bugs, glitches, and problems with it though. Poor graphics, theyre decent but can't compare to Wildcraft. Family members always get caught on trees and various parts of the terrain. There's so many glitches and bugs it annoying. This isn't a bad game, it has potential, but it needs a lot of updates. If you update this game as much as Wildcraft it would have even more downloads, and fame!"", ""I love this game but please add more to the game. Examples-Mix Breeds to play as, different maps, different AI, different places to have as a home, maybe increase the max level, add daily quests, more bosses for each area like wildcraft, maybe add pets. That's all the examples I have for the game as if now, and I know it's very hard to add things to a game, it takes alot of work and time. I'm not forcing you to add these bits just what I would personally want to see in the game. Stay Safe."", 'Amazing. The game is basically ""Have fun and farm with friends!"", although its rare to see people talk. Back then I was around level 70 with all the skins, but thanks for adding new ones.However, this game can start alot of friendships, but last time I saw the game it was 3+. Now this is going to attract alot of disgusting things to happen! Why though?', ""Compared to the cats simulator they made, this one is extremely glitchy, and a bit harder to control. Also there is no Pekingese. :'( overall, the game is like all the other newer simulators they made. Level up, raise a family, fight enemies. The online for this app actually has more people than the cats, which alarms me since it doesnt play as well. But if your a dog lover, its a lot of fun, both online and offline. 3.5 stars"", ""My experience with this app is great. I've played for only 5 months and I'm level 200! But one suggestion... Could you make it more like cat sim? Like with clothes and hats. There is nothing wrong with this app. Whoever gives it under 4 stars must be insane. All your games are amazing. Thank you for creating these child friendly games. My sister is 6 and is obsessed with it. My parents have to turn the internet off so she can stop playing! Also can you let us go upstairs?? That's all. Merry Xmas"", ""Actually, not that bad of a game! I've played it a while back and here's a tip: The cow boss is a lot easier especially if you have a family of dogs. It only took my 3 days to get all the skins because of it! I really think it's interesting. I only rated it 4 stars because the game just looks a little bland- Maybe a new map would be great. Other than that, it's worth the download!"", ""I enjoy the game but when my friend and I try to connect to the same multiplayer group it immediately sends error messages we have tested it out too and since we can't game together we have lost interest in the game. If it was possible I would gladly play it because it is quite a cute game."", ""I really love this game but after you get to level 200 it gets a little boring. There need to be updates that add more things. 1) The max level needs to be 300 and I'm on level 200 and I can't upgrade my dog anymore because it says I have to be level 201. 2) More skins. 3) Maybe 1 or 2 new bosses. 4) There needs to be private friend chats like WildCraft. Also my game crashes at least once a day and every time I open the menu in single player there's an ad. Every time I leave a game there's an ad"", ""It's not a bad game but it does seem annoying when it comes to the ads in every single gameplay.

It's so addictive, and a great time killer! The prices for buying coins are PERFECT! Can you guys please add gifting? I would love to gift my friends different dog breeds. I wish I can give this game more than five stars. I REALLY recommend this for dog lovers! Getting coins (for me) is quite easy. I spend them all, and I always get more than 1,000 coins a day. And no, I don't buy them I just play and do my quests. BEST DOG SIMULATER EVER!☆☆☆☆☆"", 'Even though the game had great graphics it was too hard to control and the game glitched where the animals could hide and run into buildings. It made them impossible to get to. Not to mention they were very hard to find as well.', ""Game was alright at first other than ads popping up every time I check my family stats or other family members getting stuck in fences. I liked the different dog breeds on here and the different maps. I decided to register for an permanent so I could log into a different device account. I filled everything out but it kept saying This email is already in use so I tried a different email I have and it said the same thing. Now I can't get an account to come back to if I decide to uninstall. Pls fix"", 'This would have five stars but it has problems. 1: Some of the names people have are inappropriate and need to be blocked and they use hashtags and other stuff to say bad words. This needs to stop. 2: When I play in multiplayer with full wifi bars I constantly get disconnected even when I am refreshing lists of who is playing. Frustrating!!!😡 Other than that great game! 😁', ""Dude what happened to this game. I used to have it on my iPad like 5 or more years ago and I loved it, so I downloaded it on my phone and it sucks butt!! Sure the map is bigger now, but it's way less detailed, and you cant interact with anything, like you used to be able to climb buildings in the junk yard and eat out of trash cans. I'm really sad this game got worse for some reason :("", ""This game is my favorite. Now it takes years to change region. Turbo Rocket, WORK ON THIS GAME PLEASE!! I really need it back. I love this app so much, just update it a little more, and work on it. It's like, when I change region it takes 20 hours to change region. It's the best game ver, better than roblox, but just please make the loading only 10 seconds and less ads and actions. Please make it more playeable. Add more skins as well so more people will play it and love it and rate 5 stars."", ""This is a really good boredom-killing game that I would recommend to anyone who likes animal simulation games. The reason I only gave it four stars is because you only get thirty quests to complete,and after that you get no more. Also,the dog breeds are kind of expensive. Over all,it's a good time consuming game."", ""Everytime I go to the settings menu to add points, the game goes to an ad, and 9.5/10 times, the game freezes, and I have to exit completely, and go back into the game. It's really annoying. And my mate always gets stuck somewhere and can't follow me."", 'This is a great game! There are fun bosses, unique areas, and more custom features. This is not a five-star game, though. I really like the concept of this game. It needs more quests, more action! I know you can do it, make it come to life!

Dog Simulator,"The best MULTIPLAYER Dog Simulator available on Android!

Play as a real puppy - jump, bark, destroy the house and do whatever you want. Now with a multiplayer mode you can play your friends and people all over the world. Cute puppies and fun adventures are waiting for you!

ONLINE MULTIPLAYER
Play online with animal lovers all over the world. Play together with other dogs, meet new friends and compete with them for the best score. See if anyone can match your skills as a naughty dog. You can create your own games which can be joined by your friends.

DOGS AND PUPPIES
If dogs are your favourite pets then this is the game for you. Play as your favourite dog breed: corgi, shiba and husky puppies are waiting for you. If you love bigger dogs select one of the collies, bulldogs or a greyhound to bring even more cuteness to the game. And if that’s not enough try a wolf, direwolf or a giraffe (well it’s a sneaky greyhound dressed as a giraffe). 

UPGRADE AND DRESS YOUR DOG
When you press either single player or the multiplayer button in the menu you always go to the scene where you can change your dog and dress it as you like, using blue arrows on the both sides of the dog and buttons on the top of the screen. You can dress your doggy with multiple hats, collars and funny glasses. Then everyone can see your cool outfit in multiplayer games.

LOCATIONS
There are six locations. First, awesome house were you smash some objects and learn the game. Second, nice garden with a dog that will follow you and a grill party to ruin. Third is a shop with lots of objects that can be smashed into pieces. Fourth and fifth are on a huge farm full of animals and people where you can chase sheep to get points. The last one is a crazy town with tons of stuff to destroy and funky missions.

TIME CHALLENGE
In every level in the single player mode there is a rotating clock. When you run into it, you can activate time challenge mode. In this mode you have to destroy as many objects and do as many interactions as fast as possible. For the points you earn the stars and more gold.

NIGHT MODE
Score one star in the last level to unlock a secret night mode. It contains new time challenges for every stage with increased difficulty and even bigger rewards. See if you’re a true expert.

SIMPLE CONTROLS
You can use the joystick, on the left to move your dog, jump button on the right to make it fly and swipe to look around. You can use the hit button on the right to smash objects with your awesome dog power.

QUALITY SETTINGS
The game will automatically detect which quality settings to apply for your device, but you can change them in the settings menu.

FACEBOOK AND SOCIAL SHARING
At the end of the time challenge, the popup will show up allowing you to post your score on Facebook or Twitter. You can also share the image of your dog on in the scene where you change dogs and dress them.",The most beautiful and realistic Dog Simulator on the Google Play!,"5,000,000+",5000000,9077470,4.193237,291134,2415,"[36994, 9365, 17326, 23882, 203423]",0.0,True,INR,False,,,,True,"₹115.36 - ₹4,999.00 per item",Swift Apps LLC,7340652782675193720,info@swiftapps.pl,http://swiftapps.pl/,"Królewska 65A/1

The controls are 'okay' I guess...you only get as a control button a attack button, a jumping button, and a go left, right, Forward, and back button. All the maps are good I had fun playing it. The first two maps are pretty good and easy. Enjoy"", ""I love the game and all, but there's one problem. I spent like 4 hours as a Great Collie running around and destroying stuff and finally getting 83k. When I changed region to join my brother, it all went away. This is very agitating. I still have my 153 gems, which is good. Overall, this game deserves 5 stars, even if I lost 4 hours of progress."", 'Really good but theres a bug im experiencing ( sorry if thats spelled wrong ) where some of the things you destroy are stuck in the ground ( barrels, hay stacks, crates, pumpkins, and tables in particular ) please do fix this! Also i would love it if there were more levels this game is really fun thanks for making it!', ""I can't even describe how good it is! But the problem is it don't shows ur score to go to next lvl but it's ok anyway! I'll try to understand it soon! The controls are super easy, I always rage quit cuz big lvls always hit me xD and when I randomly join the garden we always go run and try to get in the house first till time runs up! XD I always play that xD it's a really good game!"", ""I love this app so much. It's kinda hard when you have to walk but its the best simulator I've ever had. I love the new places u can go and the challenges. Love this game. Hope you people like it too. And you get different dogs anytime. And love wrecking houses and etc."", 'I love this app! The controls are so easy! I rated 4 stars because you still have to fix one thing. When you get off your device for 7 minutes then get back on your device it freezes a little bit.', ""It is really bad until it really spoils my mood when playing this game. 1.you don't show the score that we need to beat in order to go to the next round. 2.why does the dog needs to jump over the thing on the road when it is not that high. 3. sometimes there is point & sometimes don't when you hit the thing. 4. I already pressed the jump button for so many times, the dog just stucked there & couldn't go up. Please fix those problems as soon as possible. It is good game but bad quality."", ""I love this game! It's cute, fun, and addicting! You get to play and act as a real dog and you can destroy stuff in every place that you visit! It has cool maps and other kinds of dogs, too! It has great graphics and is entertaining! It's one of the best games I tried out, including the Cat Simulator I just rated! I also love dogs because they're cute and playful! Thank you guys for making this game! I think you made my day today! 🐶👍"", 'Well this is a fun game but when I saw the game wanted to rate this game and when I looked at the ""no"" sign the puppy was sad. I couldn\'t handle that pain so I said ""yes"" This game was fun but there are a few bugs that when I jump anywhere i get stuck at objects. Also all the humans and dog furs are blurred with bad texture. But it\'s good anyways 👌🏻', 'ITS SO COOL!!! I love dogs and thats just what this game is!!! Simply by being a cute pup! I wish you would add a trick button so when you press it the dog would do something like Sitting, roll over, back flip, bark(speak), and even play dead... And the people will react to the puppy and if they like it you will get +2 coins every time they like it so please and that update and u can add some more dog tricks if you do add it so yeah... Thats all! bye..!', ""Fun and addictive. I decided to install this on a whim with my boyfriend. Although there are many ads, this game is fun to kill time and spread happiness. Sometimes it is a bit buggy and you're unable to jump up though."", ""been playing since like 2015 (on and off) and oh my god it's so addicting and nostalgic, I come back to it every now and then for a nostalgia trip and stay for the fun. 10/10 game even though others might not agree. the stupid (ADORABLE) unity asset dogs make me happy beyond words and I honestly dont even know why"", 'This is a very adorable game! I love the text that pops up and the achievements. There are many levels that humans come in every day! Anyways the dogs all have great fur colors,Graphics and cuteness! I would recommend this to any dog lover!', ""It's a very good game but I would like it if there animals were cheaper and i always had i problem that it says I'm disconnected but it plays me an add... yeah dont get it... I love this game and the other ones pls dont make me uninstall it and lose everything just to play it again to play online and just do the same thing..."", ""very very good game the background is amazing and the concept of the game that is to destroy everyrhing is the best part but i would suggest you to have some more levels so that the game is long and fun and you should add 'choose your background music' feature"", 'I like this app cause,im a dog lovers!! If anyone wanted like to be a dog? Like uh i dont know how to explain but this game is for a dog lover! The reason i give ☆☆☆☆ Stars is because sometimes when you jump the dogs/puppies they will like stuck at the floor so you have to restart it! Its just so annoying! Even when you are on a Quest lik the timer and yea..its pretty diffrent from cat simulator but,i like cat simulator more even tho im a dog lovers but like..Dude,fix your game..', ""Best dog game ever But there's 1 issue. Can you please make it to where the dog can run fully and knock over tables and stuff, not glitch and turn ? It's like that for my bro too. Pls make an update. When we run and knock stuff over outside and inside, it makes us turn back or we glitch and turn, It's glitched. u just need to make an update to fix the problem pls. Then I'll give it 5 stars. And share with my friends. I got other update idea. Can u PLS make a chat box so we can chat with people."", ""The concept and quality of the game is great. But be aware that if you play often enough online, you can just like any other multiplayer game, you'll notice toxic players and possibly even a literal demonic encounter. And you'd think this game is for little kids. This game, like other multiplayer games, are NOT for Christians at all! So all in all if you are a good person, be aware of playing on multiplayer everyday. Multiplayer should be removed. Can't run anarchy with such a despicable world."", ""It has such great graphics if you like something simple it is a little weird with the humans faces but that's fine it's just that they are a little flat but other than that it's a really nice game and you should get it's for your kids if they really like dogs and they like simulators"", 'Very good over all! Cool levels, Many ""Combos"" and much more. But, sometimes my game has a bug. Please fix this. But overall, it\'s a good game. You should atleast try it', 'I love the levels but please add more. It is so fun that we get to destroy, but, the stuff costs to much I had 2000 coins and gems I had to get stuff for my pup. After I did that, I had 10 coins, and 12 gems. Please fix it.', 'Fun game its a good game cant stand the rotation of the screen love it but theres some stuff thats missing like how do you know how many points you need to get to unlock one map or land. Please update that for now i uninstalled its not bad maybe a 2-3 is a good rating for this game hopefully soon it will be 5 stars game thank you for reading my request ♡.', 'Wonderful game! 10/10 It does glitch sometimes, but almost every game does. Super fun, easy to learn, and you can even use it to relieve stress!', ""It is so awesome I can't stop playing and I love to ruin things like a store because I going to the store and I love dogs.You should try this game if you like this game you should play it more often if you don't like the game just find a game that is a good fit for you.Don't forget to share with friends!!!!"", ""Good game I used to play this when I was four and five years old now I'm 9 in a corder and I still love this game it brings back memories of when I was little thank you so much for making this game now I have to get used to the controls again😂 because I haven't played this in so long lol🤭🤣🤣🥰 keep up on the good work,!!!!!!!😍😉"", ""It's a very great game.But the dogs are too much expensive...and the graphics are awesome! I want more places..and make the dogs less the gems and money...I wish you could add more in this game in the future so more people will install this great game!"", ""It's cute and fun. Not at all different from the cats one. Just with dogs instead. You still jump around and knock down and break things. That's more of a cat thing, so seeing dogs jump up a counter and knock stuff down is kinda weird."", ""It's overall a fun game to play, you will get addicted to it. However, it would be nice to have the option to switch the joypad for both left handed and right handed. I suck at this game and find it difficult to move the dog around with my left thumb as my a right handed"", ""It's a nice time killer and it's great for when you have nothing better to do. There's not many maps and they're easy to unlock. It took me less than an hour to go through the entirety of it. Maybe add some more maps."", ""It's really fun but the reason I put 4 stars is that it takes a while to get on the next level in the shop level still a really good game though also make the ladder easier to climb up and make the dogs cheaper please"", ""The graphics are terrible. It is these games that use a timer and in the game I can't even jump instead I get frozen in mid air. Soo cheap."", ""My kids love this game so I think it's the best game for my kids Even though my kids loved it I tried this game and it's actually really fun so I think everybody out there should try it yeah totally Chivas game is about it. Awesome dogs they did really bad things that I can sit love this game so whatever"", 'I like this game but there is no missions no more places to go to you should really update the game so it can have more features', 'Amazing reflexes, quality, and graphics! Its cool because you can releaar your stress and smash stuff XD and you can play with friends and have a lot of fun! 💜💜😀', ""It's a really fun game you get to choose many cute puppies and smash everything just to make humans regret this and just for them to get furious but when I installed this game from yesterday they have levels and without the challenge all your coins first get higher then lower for some reasons of give it a five star if you remove the challenge thing its irritating me plus I uninstalled it sadly 😒"", 'Although you have not fixed the breaking objects dissapearing and never coming back, items being broken as you enter a level and items being driven into the ground and will launch you into the air if you try to knock it over at a certian angle -_-', ""Love the game, however I'm stuck at level 3 and I am not sure of what am I supposed to do or even what objects to wreck. So far I am getting a high score but not a star. Therefore I have no clue what I should be doing/what score do I need to move to level 4."", 'The game is fun and the graphics is great!...But I rated it three stars because when we create a custom game it dont have a password and other players join in...And by the way they always punch us and im pissed of them...

The graphics are so cute, and gameplay it\'s super fun! However I have two bugs to report. 1. When I go to type (change dog name, etc.) The game freezes. 2. Sometimes, the graphics overlap, so when I\'m in the ""Journal"" menu, the date and activity icons at the bottom overlap the bottom and make it difficult to read. These are minor problems, so 5 stars :D', ""Loved this game when it came out but never got to finish. Came back to it, and sadly the lack of updates have made performance pretty bad. On my Note 10+ in fifteen minutes of gameplay, it froze once and had many, many issues with touch screen responsiveness. :( Hopefully the devs come back to it one day, because the gameplay was always really fun, but it's been three years since the last update, so I guess I shouldn't hold my breath."", ""8/10 Really good game, would recommend. Only one problem: When I try to type something in (like a dog's name), the game freezes and has to be restarted. So I can only stick to the randomly generated options. I would hope to see this fixed, but overall it doesn't take much from the experience."", ""Great game, I love the dogs, the breeding mechanics, and the story. My singular issue: the game definitely needs some optimization for mobile. Races that require 4+ dogs or have weather events like snow quickly lag, resulting in bad timing and subsequently losing races you shouldn't have a problem in. Even after I ran my phone in developer mode and forced higher processing power, the races still lag. My suggestion: get the game off Steam and play on your laptop. It's well worth it."", ""Really fun game! Easy to understand, fun, and nice to look at. You can't pick your own names for the dogs without the game crashing. You can still use the name randomiser and change the harness colour, so it's still pretty good. Also the sound can't be disabled for during races, it's still really loud."", 'I love it but recently ive been getting a bunch of bugs from it, its been lagging alot and just today ive had to restart the app five times because it kept freezing. Its an amazing game and i love playing it nonetheless. The bugs include not registering my touch, clicking multiple times when ive only touched the screen once (a dog got accidentally hired because of this lol), then when i tried to add a sponsor it glitched or something cause it only showed a blue bar where sponsors usually are.', ""I've played this game a couple times over the years. The art is super cute and well done. I do feel like the game could use more depth and fun updates. But for what it is it's a cute simple game. I enjoy it, but do get bored with it quickly. The races are very monotonous, I just wish there was more to the game."", ""the game gets 5 stars, the port to mobile is what I'm reviewing. playing on a galaxy s9 and its glitchy on the display, the extra length of the s9 screen means there are two bars on the sides that show the background of my phone - very distracting. another glitch is when naming dogs it simply freezes up and you have to restart, so I have a few dogs with some pretty silly random names. a few times in the kennel screen, I have trouble petting or clicking on my dogs. fixes on the way I hope! <3"", ""This is a very cute game and I absolutely adore the pixel style and that there's a nice selection of dogs to choose for your team. The story is very interesting and I like it. It's a game I always come back to play. The are a few bugs, like the game freezing when I'm selecting dogs or try to change names, on a rare occasion, the game will crash as soon as I launch the app, but that doesn't keep me from trying to play such a nice game. I definitely recommend this game to all my friends."", 'I love this game! Its like it was designed specifically for me lol. Lovely design, fun theme, easy to figure out how to play yet hard enough to keep it interesting. One small glitch is that it crashes when I try to rename the dogs. But overall I just love that this game exists! Long live sled dogs and pixel art :)', ""Still has some bugs, Can't type without a freeze and it won't save properly. I tried saving and starting up again and it just brought me back to the very begining. Besides that, I love this game. Hope it gets fixed soon!"", 'This game is really fun! I love the dogs and discovering their personalities, but I do have a major problem with the game. For example, yesterday I played the game for about 15 mins, I had the perfect puppy about to join my team and I was preparing to join League 6. Then today I open the app and NONE of the progress I had made yesterday was saved.', 'This is a game I love on Steam and am excited to play on Mobile... Except for the constant freezes and crashes when trying to type. I literally cannot type anything without the game freezing and crashing.', 'I actually found this game after seeing the movie \'The Call Of The Wild\' and dog sledding fascinated me. I couldn\'t find a single game featuring dog sledding that was actually a ""decent"" game. This game does cost real world money but after that everything in the game is absolutely free! It\'s adorable and I love the old school pixel graphics. The dogs are cute as ever and I love the concept of them all having their own personalities and preferred positions. 5 stars for sure!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐', ""I love this game so much! I've been playing it on my computer for SO long but I really wanted to be able to play it on the go so I finally bought it on my phone. And it's still thrilling to me! The gameplay is easy and the art style/graphics are adorable! However, I wish there was more dogs to choose from. And the naming thing doesn't work but that doesn't bother me too much because I can still play the game. :) I hope this gets to the creator of the game because I would really love to see some new updates! Please and thank you in advance if you choose to update the game! :) P.S. I would really love to see a Pitbull in this game. (its my favorite breed. x3) Again, please and thank you. :) Have a wonderful day! :)"", ""Had a lot of fun on my old devise but now on my phone when ever I try to change anything's name the game freezes the music keeps going but the only thing I can do is turn off and back on my phone then close the app so I can play again. It's getting annoying. Please fix this big problem."", 'I love this game, it\'s what every game developer on the Play Store should take notes on as being a great example of enjoyable and the ""best bang for your bark ( heh heh no sorry)"". It\'s a pixel retro game with a relaxing tone with a twist, introducing the soothing music and the ambience of nature. It really engages you for a mobile game as you have to work to advance through several tiers, enough said. MUST TRY!', ""I seen the game, loved it. Played tutorial, loved it. Can't name my dogs or name saves, or else the game freezes. That sucks. I'll still play it, but it sucks that I can't name anything."", 'My game kept crashing when i tried to load it on my device. The game is nice and all, but i really wish u could get a refund after what ive just experienced. The naming system ESPECIALLY needs work thought the harnesses do work so I dont understand. Fair warning fir those about to buy this game, it may be better on PC.', 'I just needed to send in feedback. Love the game from videos but every time I try to change a dogs name, the game freezes. It lets me use the ""random"" option, but I can\'t type a nee name', 'This game is great! I love playing this on car trips. It had no add and you can play it offline! The only downside is that you have to pay for it. But that pays for no ads which is definitely worth it. I recommend this game!', ""See I love this game but it's in serious need of an update. More story, better races, it just feels like its leading nowhere. Maybe we encounter the famous dog or actually beat out rival more than a couple of times. The lack of update is why it's 3 star."", ""I really enjoy this game, but I do have one or two tid bits of problems with it. 1. I can't name my dogs without freezing up. 2. I wish there were more breeds of dogs and possibly mutts when you cross breed the dogs? patterns would be cool too."", ""It's an amazing game, I like that you get to customize your dogs but there is a huge flaw that sucks and I hope will get fixed soon. The naming bug. Whenever I try to name my dogs, it freezes and I have to shut off my phone just to restart the app."", ""I absolutely love the game! The only fault I have with it is that sometimes when I'm racing, once I run out of treats the stations where you refill on treats wont work for me? I hope that made sense, but I'm just a little confused..."", ""Whenever I try too change a dog's name my game will freeze and the only way to unfreeze it is to close and reopen the app. Other than that it is a good game."", ""Very very glitchy. Some days I cant pet my dogs. I cant rename anything as whenever I go to type something the game promptly crashes. Very annoying. Fix the issue and I'd give 4 maybe 5 stars lol"", 'The only thing I request of this game is maybe a few more dog species and a little more character customization. What I mean by species is that you can send a female dog out and she might come back with wolf hybrids that can look like any type of wolf, such as the canis lupus, grey wolf, and the timber wolf.', ""I love the art style of this game and the fact that you get your own dog sled team. BUT I'm giving this game a 3 star do to the fact that I wish they added new dog breeds like a GreatDane, Beagel, or a ChowChow for example, OR when you breed 2 dogs like a White Husky and a German Shepherd you get a White German Shepherd and not one or the other. What I love most about this game is getting new dogs but once I got all the dogs the game just kinda got boring."", 'This is a really good game except the fact that the game freezes when ever I try to type in an ame for a dog,but it will let me use the random option though.', ""Dog Sled Saga is the best! The graphics are so cute, and it's so easy to learn. Breeding for certain stats is entertaining. Will definitely recommend."", ""I can't write a specific name for a dog or my whole screen freezes I can only choose random names can you maybe fix that if you can? Thank you other then that it's great!"", 'I think dog sled saga is a very fun and adorable game it has good graphics and easy to control. Manly there are no adds which makes me really happy. Thanks for making this game.', 'loved the game and it would have been 5 stars but when i breed my dogs and had to name the pup it wont allow me. so now the game is unplayable. pls fix this.', 'Really great game! For the first bit it is really fun game play, and adding to the story is fun, but this game needs an update. After a certain point it is just the same thing over and over again.', 'Do NOT breed two puppies at once I did and now my game is stuck on the ""name this puppy"" screen and I can\'t do anything about that. Ive restarted my phone, exited the app and re entered it, I REALLY don\'t want to uninstall it but I might have to 😞 other than that the game is great ^-^ but....can I get some help please? 😂', ""Every time I try to change my dog's name, my app crashes and I'm forced to restart my phone as my phone won't get out of landscape mode. Ridiculous."", ""Touch controls don't work in app. Unable to pass the opening splash screen. Waste of money if app is broken."", ""I love this game very much. I've had it on my computer. My only complaint now is the game won't even load at all its just the blue screen and it won't load"", 'I have played this game for about 3 years now and it will not let me rename my dogs or saves.

It does not matter if you have premium, you won't be receiving any matches at all (I had subscribed to the premium, still the same). It's like a window shopping app where you just keep scrolling and scrolling until you're satisfied without hoping to get anything. For once I thought this app could be genuine and I purchased the premium, but no, if all I had to do was left and right swipe people, I might have as well stayed on Tinder for free."", 'The UI is quite user friendly. But few things which can be improved on. 1. Message notification doesn\'t pop up a lot of times 2. Call notification doesn\'t pop up ever, plus call drops multiple times 3. Filter option doesn\'t work properly, for example if I choose age range 33-36, I still see people of age 23 4. Algo for common interest can be improved specially for best bees feed, I get best bees who want ""Something Casual"" while my preference is ""Relationship""', 'Totally wast of time & Money, I have not received positive responses from the opposite gender. The 30-minute spotlight feature, promising up to 10x matches, did not help. People seem less active, making it challenging to find potential matches. Considering trying other apps, Bumble has not been useful recently. I do not recommend it based on my recent experiences.', ""1. Poor algorithm. When you don't have premium, it shows you all persons within small distance. Once you subscribe to premium, the people shown would be around 100 km. Very few local profiles are shown. So the developer's motive seems to attract people to Premium subscription by showing good profiles, then serve trash. 2. Even though I cancelled the subscription in advance, it charged me for another month and didn't give premium features. 3. Useless app. Never coming back."", 'As a long-time user of Bumble, my recent experience has been disappointing. Despite being active, I have not received positive responses from the opposite gender. The 30-minute spotlight feature, promising up to 10x matches, did not help. People seem less active, making it challenging to find potential matches. Considering trying other apps, Bumble has not been useful recently. I do not recommend it based on my recent experiences.', ""Its definitely a good app, but could use a few improvements. I don't use premium, but I don't mind it much so far. Anyhow, I do find it irritating that women always have to make the first move. I get why Bumble chose to do so, but it's irritating I always have to text first, especially since matches expire. Sometimes I get busy or forget to check the app, and I lose a lot of matches. I think it'd be nice sometimes if the other person could also text first."", 'Waste of time and money, the location of people is totally hit and miss, when you do ""match"" with someone it is debatable if they are actually real or generated by the app to keep you interested. For an app that is meant to compliment your social circle/find people with similar interests and so on, no one actually talks. Might just stick with the old-fashioned way!', 'I can not escape the feeling of a jacked up algorithm. One that puts people on the bottom despite their subscription in some sort of ""lead with a carrot"" business model. That or no one\'s on this app, and the app does not seem to want to take people who have not been on the app in months in the algorithm. Furthermore, there seems to be no quick, obvious, and easy way to end your subscription.', ""I used the app for about one year and had a few decent dates out of it. However, as soon as my paid membership expired, literally overnight, I went from having zero people interested in me to 47, of course being prompted to go back to the paid version. Didn't change location or filters during that time, so obviously, they are manipulating the truth and the end user."", 'For an app that requires access to your location, you\'d think they\'d give you an accurate mileage estimate for people near you, but nope they can\'t be bothered to do that. Just saw someone who lives in the next state over from me and, according to Bumble, they\'re 85 miles away from me. However, when I enter the city on Google maps, it gives me a much more accurate mileage: 156 miles. That\'s a 71 mile difference, nearly double Bumble\'s ""estimate.""', 'The worst of all dating apps. Like Tinder, gives you options from ridiculous distances, especially if youre in rural areas. Most people are visitors from very far. The worst part is once youve swiped left on a potential match they are removed from your likes and you probably will never see them again.""you\'ve missed a potential match"" forever. Also they put the location at the bottom so you have to scroll the whole profile just to see the distance factor. Overall a very bad experience', ""This app is ok but needs work. I canceled my premium. One of the big thing that must be added is letting me know when the last time a person logged on. That way I'm not wasting time on someone who hasn't logged on in a month. That's a waste of a swipe especially a super swipe. Also need to separate straight people from gay. As I have swiped on the wrong person and they get all offended. If these things were fixed I would keep logging in."", ""Terrible app! you have to pay for basic Things like just to see who liked you you can only see the people that complimented your profile and that's limited, You have to pay for everything like super swipes & to go back if you made a mistake. They took down one of my photos for going against community guide lines but it's a picture of me in a long dress no nudity nothing inappropriate. & whatever preferences youre allowed to choose (age and distance) doesn't narrow down the field"", ""Still an awful app, I've tried it multiple times and men never see their related matches. We get search results from 97 miles away from people who don't match our criteria. And you can tell even from the blurry images that you never see the people who actually do swipe on you. It's entirely designed to keep you swiping without any actual results. Don't waste your time"", 'It\'s just as bad if not worse than Tinder surprisingly. Customer service is 0/10. I can\'t get a hold of any humans to discuss my problems, I\'ve sent at least 10 emails. I get photos randomly taken down because they ""violate"" community standards according to the algorithm. I\'ve purchased the lifetime membership twice and, like anyone, deleted and reinstalled the app many times, but now I dont have the lifetime membership, and they won\'t fix it. Summary: All dating apps suck.', ""I think it's more likely to get struck by lightning and win the lottery at the same time than get a match. It's way too easy to accidentally swipe left, and those swiped on can't come back, and the highlights cost 8 bucks each. Like, who even? Fix your app."", ""What's the use of having the dating interface if you can't even contact/connect to a prospect without having to pay a bloody fee? And even then, even if you do want to spend on it, the chances of getting catfished is unbelievably high. The aspect of this side of the app is completely useless. I will give it props if you're using it for business networking purposes and works well if that is your ONLY objective. The dating interface is bonkers."", ""it's very picky and decisive wanting you to spend money just like any other app. they shouldn't just give the option free to connect with anyone but they should make a lot easier if you want to say hello or block or do what you would like explicit or not. there's filters for everything. just make it all around app that everybody can use. it's 2023 and this is the longest run on sentence I've ever done. but we all know what we're looking for in the beginning and in the end and who may b in middle"", ""All the other dating apps I get plenty of matches, but bumble is awful at what it's supposed to do. No matches, and because of the time limit to message you often miss the matches you do get. Pointless app and a waste of time. Edited, after the reply I received more likes than before after I left a review, strange, then they started to get less and Ive just realised the compliment feature has been removed. I think the free compliments were the only thing that made bumble worth using."", ""Because you can't filter results by important categories like religion without paying, the app is essentially useless. You are forced to weed through thousands of profiles that aren't close to your value specifications. The profiles layout is also a mess, listing interests in a buckshot-style jumble where things like children, religion, age, location, etc are thrown into the mix randomly and you have to look around more to find it (those should be at the top of the list)."", ""It's...ehhh. My issues are the inability to filter out poly/ENM profiles looking for unicorns, continuing to get likes from men when I am a lesbian, the constant message ads and empty notifications, and the high cost of premium. Been using it for a few months now, met one potential person but I'm demoralized. I won't renew my subscription."", ""Bumble is useless without a premium subscription. All filters except age & distance are now locked behind a paywall, so rooting through all the bad matches to find someone is a chore. You only get 24 hours to respond to a match, otherwise you have to pay to rematch. And if you accidentally swipe left on someone you do want to match with, you have to pay to undo it. If the woman matches but doesn't start chatting within 24 hours, (Something that happens A LOT) the match disappears completely."", ""The customer service for Bumble is absolutely terrible!! I have contacted them over 10 times in a two week span and Bumble has not replied to ANY of my inquiries. My account is stuck on photo verification and I cannot access any othet part of my account. I am currently paying for the Premium option as well. Don't use this app - they dont care about you at all."", ""Not sure how I feel about it. So far I like how the verification process goes and the app runs smooth but been on it for 2 weeks with premium and not worth it. You don't really get as much people due to the fact that the premium is expensive and also the notification when you do get someone doesn't really appear on either the app notification or email. Also anyone you've liked you can't tell if they even seen the like. Definitely needs more work for the cost."", ""I like this app, in my opinion it' s very nice but it's just ridiculously expensive. probably the most expensive app I've tried. so I subscribed in different app although I still use the free features on Bumble. Some things could be better. don't like the fact that only match girls can do first move, think that's silly. I've been on a date with a girl and she complained that men never say anything, then I said we can't, first move has to be from girl."", ""When you pay to upgrade and it run out. I have found that when you get likes the system doesn't match you with them. I wants you to upgrade. They then timed out and their gone. Don't pay for the upgrade or you'll just have to delete your account like I did. It should be above all, about finding a connection."", 'Having a limit on likes per day isn\'t a bad idea, but this app\'s limit is almost cartoonish. I can\'t spend more than a few minutes per 24 hours swiping without being told I need to pay 3 WHOLE DOLLARS to keep going. It\'s asinine. On top of that, almost everything else is locked behind paywalls. Though I do like that you can list your pronouns without having to first pick ""man or woman."" But that\'s just basic decency, not a feature', ""I've been on Bumble for a few weeks now. Ended up paying for the boost, matched with someone who, for their prompt, asked me to verify my photo. Prior to this I had tried probably 20 times to verify, and was never able to. Yes I tried photos with just myself. Mimicking the pose, hand gestures, and even location exactly, but couldn't verify. Now I'm stuck on the verification screen, I'm being ignored by the support team. 0/5"", ""To the pros: fairly clean & simple UI, tho a bit outdated. Cons: gps based search, meaning swiping endlessly tons of people in proximity, including tourists & people in the airport and there's no way to filter out. And you have to scroll all way down to find out person is living somewhere else or doesn't disclose. So looks like tinder at this point and more oriented towards finding one night stand nearby. Exhausting & very disappointing experience for me and after a long time trying it, I'm out"", ""Even after having premium it doesn't let's text to someone who liked my profile. It clearly showed in best bees match. But it didn't let me text. What a pathetic app. They just want you to keep browsing and keep paying for super swipes or compliments even after buying premium. You will get nothing here. I think they just got some profiles when they launched the app. Might be no longer active because this app doesn't let people text even after liking from both sides."", ""Bamble has completely changed my dating game! The interface is so user-friendly and the profiles are detailed. I've had some great conversations and even met up with a few matches. The safety features make me feel comfortable putting myself out there .."", 'Sent a support message because the app was malfunctioning and did not hear back. Super frustrating as it\'s deleted messages, not notified me about matches, and given me at least 20 ""ghost matches."" Meaning that it tells me that I have \'seconds left to reapond\' and never see a match or any reference to one when I log in. 8/18 Update: Messaged the support team on FB yesterday like the moderator suggested and haven\'t heard back.....', ""The app generally is easy to navigate. But it works on Likes. If a person likes another person, that other person will not see the profile of whom has 'Liked them, unless they subscribe. I tried with and without subscription, if you don't pay you don't see the 'Liker'. I think there is misunderstanding of this being like Facebook and folk randomly 'like' . Bumble needs the 'how long since been active' or filter out the 'non-users' somehow. The speed dating is awful 😖 Get rid or show a pic."", ""The facial recognition and it's term in this app is sucks!! My profile pics is exactly as my now i take, but still wrong! Why not verify person in manually like the other app dating? AI mostly can be wrong! And the face fiture of people can change as the time always change. Hope this app can use other method to verified person!!"", ""So I decided to buy a week of premium. It's not worth the $20. Once it's gone you just get people that don't match your filters. Having to pay to filter people based on important things like having or wanting kids in the first place is pretty sleezy. They also take away any spotlights you have left over when premium expires. The distance filter doesn't look at where people live, and is terrible for people looking for long-term. Prepare to either pay too much for Bumble or be disappointed."", ""My biggest complaint is there's no swipe priority to people who superswiped. It'll give me a notification that I got superswiped but it'll take me days to find out who actually did it. I would greatly appreciate if you could fix that as pretty much every other app places priority on that stuff and not having it makes superswipes seem kinda useless."", 'Would never recommend, because of 0 support. Wrote 5 times - no response. Bought a lifetime Premium. Had to simply reinstall the app, and now the premium purchase is gone, verifying is not possible (just shows ""Oops"" on their website). Have sent various requests, almost a week past - no answer. Waste of money.', ""Terrible. I tried the BFF part and every woman I matched with is terrible at communicating. It doesn't seem like anyone is serious about making friends even though their profile says it. They all take over 1-2 days to reply or not at all and they even messaged me first. I ask open ended questions too. It seems people are just looking for validation by matching. If you're looking for genuine friendships, this ain't it. These people are fake and some are just looking for IG followers."", ""Don't buy the spot lights!!!! The app will self activate them and email support stopped trying to help! I tried just not being on for a couple days till subscription weekly one was added when I did log on it has already used it and times out! Yes I emailed them and they tried a couple time but stopped helping. Lost 5 so far. And they are not doing anything to help. Very disappointed in you guys. I'm done I've cancelled the subscription and not trying to get your help when you just blow it off."", ""I would like to love this app, but it is actively keeping matches apart. I purchased the unlimited likes package and swiped through everyone in my area, yet it still says there are people that like me nearby even though I can not swipe on anyone else. It's just trying to make me but the ability to see my likes. They don't care about people getting into relationships they just care about money.

I do however enjoy ""creating"" the new dog species! it is original, but it needs improvements overall. gets repetitive and lacks incentive after awhile. but I think many people would like it with a clear explanation of what it is', ""Really good game it gets kind of boring because it's just a loop you get a dog you merge the dog then again. I think it's a very good game though."", ""I love everything but could get lil boring rarely adds don't have to pay money it's good 😊 one thing though there is bugs like sometimes one of the dogs was tiny and hard to see maybe see what's wrong? I recommend the game though ;)"", ""This game is amazing! There are rarely ads, and the dogs are super cute! The only thing is that it gets boring sometimes but that's okay! PLEASE download this app!!!"", ""Alright, so, I really enjoyed this game at first. It was super fun, really cute, definitely addictive. However... I'm about halfway through the catalogue both for the grass track and the snow track, and now it's boring. It takes too long to get to the bigger dogs, since you only get two hours of away time. There's an upgrade for two more but... Do I wanna pay to still barely be able to buy two dogs at a higher tier? There just isn't enough to do to keep it fun. Good for a while tho!"", ""This game started out lots of fun and I was always excited to see all the new dogs you could unlock but as you get into the later stages, sometimes my best dogs are randomly deleted and replaced, I have been playing for a long while so it takes weeks and months to get a new dog but they keep getting replaced before I can get a new dog, it does it often and it's impossible to progress through the game at this point. It takes away from the cute aspects. Example; Lost my Samoyed for a Dalmatian."", 'This is a good mindless game to pass the time, it helped me fall asleep. A tutorial would have been nice, I played for days before I figured it to click on the dogs and rabbits. The look of the pit bull was disappointing. All the dogs are very happy looking except him. The devs had an opportunity to put the beautiful dogs in a positive light and they took a wrong turn with it. Last, I beat both levels in just over a week, more levels would be awesome. I am uninstalling for now.', 'okay. i love the colours and the art style used! they really compliment each other and make the game enjoyable. i REALLY like the ability to buy certain dogs as you level up!! that makes it a lot easier but still challenging enough to keep playing! one thing i would like would be the ability to purchase outfits for certain dogs, with in game watch to earn ads, and ingame cash from the dogs. overall this game is great ✌️', ""Addicting and fun, until the ads stopped working, except, of course, the ads that provide zero benefits, which also happen extremely often now. I tried restarting the app multiple times. No luck. Fix this soon or I will delete. I already had to skip a bunch of rewards that I can't get anymore because I could have gotten them by watching an ad. Not satisfied at all... :( UPDATE: They sort of fixed the issue. I can get a reward from a video once, then I need to restart the app, so 3 from 2 stars."", 'This game is great! So fun! When i downloaded it at first i was a bit skeptical thinking about how hard it would be to get more dogs when i got pretty far in the game but i actually enjoy the way they set it up greatly! How you let the dogs run to collect more coins. Its creative and a good way to not run out as well as you dont have to buy coins or watch ads for them! 😁 Love the game! Addicting, easy, and loads of fun!', ""The game isn't really challenging for the mind. Buy a dog, for ever increasing prices, or wait for a free one. Let it run on the track to make money. Combine two of same to get another dog, of a higher level. That one will get you the same income as the two old dogs, only faster, so merging dogs is usually worth it. The rest (free dogs, 20% discount, double speed) is click bait, you get something and the designers earn money. But in the ent, it's surprisingly funny and addictive. I quite like it."", 'I love this game the only thing I wish they could improve is how long you have to merge the dogs. Anyways the whole rest of the game is great!😊', 'This game is amazing and I love it. I stayed up late playing this game!! It is awesome!! I recommend it to whoever is looking at this. If you like offline games... This is for you! All you have to do to get rid of the ads is turn off your mobile data (if you have that) or turn off your interet! Then no ads. It does load, but dont worry. This is a 5 star rating!!! Love it so much. Again you can always get rid of the ads by turning off internet or mobile data. Anyway, thats my review! 🥰🐶🐕🐕\u200d🦺', 'MAGNIFIC DOG MERGE GAME 🐕 good work. Thank you! 🐩 I was about to finish the game, so I uninstall it to restart it, so much it is relaxing and awesome . 💕', ""This game was fun but you need to add a tutorial for new player's but it does help me fall asleep."", ""its a cute game, and the dogs models are adorable. it has a short, simple tutorial which is nice. I just don't like how long it takes to upgrade to the next dog. it's a slow-paced game compared to most idle games but that's not a horrible thing. the in-game purchases are also a bit overpriced. I love it as a time passer, but I'm uninstalling."", ""It's a cute game but it just feels so plain and basic. At least in Merge Planes you could get boosters, etc for the track, and there was a leader board. I don't want to watch fifty million ads just to make my dogs go faster, etc. And they don't even go that fast with the ads. Plus, the ads don't always work. You need to do more to this otherwise boring game."", ""It's a cute app, but is it fun? sort of, at your lowest stage it's fun and you merge but soon it becomes into a log on, collect reward, buy more dogs, close app, repeat. I do like that the ads aren't forced but I do watch them anyway. 1 video to double my 2 billion? sure why not. most people won't like this but I do like grind fest games. so it's cute and it's grindy, following the popular trend of merge apps. with not anything else thrown in to spice it up, that's about it."", ""The cutest game I've played so far. The game is very simple and really good for destressing. Animation is cute, and I get excited every time I get a new dog. I'm unable to play ads though so I can't redeem other features. But overall the game is just really chill and enjoyable."", 'This is a great game. But I have a problem, my progress keeps getting lost! I was at the level were I unlocked the sheltie but I come back the next day and it is gone, i still unlocked it in the book of dogs but did not have it on the track. I probably wont get a reply or a bot reply I just hope that this problem gets fixed.', 'I wanted to like this game, but there are a few things that turned me off. First of which was the farther I got in the game, the speed in which the dogs speed around the track literally made me sick. Visually it was disturbing and maybe should come with a warning. The second thing is why is the pitbull the only vicious looking design. All the other breeds look super sweet and friendly. I think the designers are perpetuating an unfair bias.', 'Fun game, but a while ago(long time) i had much progress on the game when it randomly crashed and wouldnt open, this went on for a week until i gave up. When it finally let me play it deleted most of my progress. It is now crashing again and im thinking it will do what it did previously, nice app, but please fix it so it doesnt delete progress, or atleast let us save it somehow.(im on latest version so that cant be why.)', ""This app is so so cute and fun!! But it has a bug that happened to me twice. I don't know how that happened but it was in the snow place that my fastest dog lost two times. So I have to use more money and it's so hard because of slower income because of the bug. And also the away time says I'll get my income for 4 hours when I don't use the app but it's just actually 4 minutes. I was supposed to earn at least a trillion in 4 hours but it just gives me 50 billion. It's a fun game though. = )"", 'Stopped playing it last year because constant crashes made it impossible to play. Felt the urge to play it again and glad to see that the crashes have been fixed! Cute and fun way to pass the time!', ""Thia game is an adorable idle merge game, there's enough factors that go into each dog that give the game more depth than expected, and I love that it has multiple worlds or zones that play at the same time. The only thing I think the game is lacking is a more solid active playing aspect, I'd like to see some kind of minigame alongside the idle aspects, but it's still a complete game that is worth your time."", ""Like the game as a way to kill time. Got to Pom, and it looked like it was floating? Thought nothing of it and continued to play, only to find that when I got a 2nd Pom, they wouldn't merge. Closed the app and restarted - my 2nd Pom is going and the Pom I have has been taken off the track. This has happened twice now."", ""I think that the game was very simple and easy. It was very short thought. You barley got any dogs and most other breeds can be left out. I know it is kinda tricky to find nonpopular breeds of dogs, but I still think it's great. To the game creaters, you should make one with cats and the different breeds also. I think the game was very cute and I enjoyed it."", ""well.. I liked this game, it was fun to merge the lil doggos to get more doggos. BUT. After getting over half the doggos in the regular one and almost completing the snow one, the game continuously crashes. I open it and not even 2 seconds later it crashes. Not enough time for me to do anything. It's super frustrating because I'm just so close to finishing it. I put a lot of effort into this."", ""It's an easy game to pass the time with. But a few too many ads for my liking. It's ok to have ads for bonus things like the 2x speed but i don't like that one automatically plays for 5 seconds when i close the buy-a-dog screen."", 'The music is great👍 and very happy 😊! I love the dogs 🐕 ❤ and they are very cute 😍! the racing is adorable ❤!', ""great game, I'm enjoying unlocking so many great breeds of dogs. the ads are a bit much but I'm not even mad considering you can use it for speeding up money, leveling up to a higher breed when using money, but it randomly comes up when you arent clicking anything that would start an ad and it gets quite annoy when an ad appears for no reason."", 'after a while you can no longer watch ads because the dogs are going so fast, so every time an ad tried to pop up, you have to watch your dogs run behind a loading screen for about 5-10 seconds.. I miss the ""watch an ad to make them go 2x as fast!"" or ""watch an ad to get the next level of dog!"" so yeah, the process is becoming a lot slower but I still love to poke the doggos. its actually quite addicting considering it gets laggy after a while', ""Love it! Super cute and fun! However!!! It doesn't do a good job at conveying some things. Things like the X2 multiplier lasts 2 minutes and 30 seconds. And it doesn't tell you how much your max away is. All it tells you is that you'll get 2 more hours of max away if you pay them real cash money. A bit unnecessarily annoying."", 'I love the game so much it is a cute doggy game I love I how you can get different dogs my favorite so far that I have is my best one the dalmation. I love this game! Update) I would like a ""Save"" feature. I recently uninstalled (For storage and realized ""oh fu-"".) Reinstalled and lost my progress. If you could add a save feature so i can reload my work would be nice, If its already there then ;-;-', ""Got months of playtime out of this. Simple idler with ROCK SOLID design. Art is adorable, control is intuitive, and lots of dogs means it last you a while. A few design elements raise its quality of life as time goes on: The quick-buy button (not real $) for the smallest dog eventually moves up the ladder as you unlock new dogs, so merge chains don't become impossibly long slogs. And you can always tap the dogs on your track for a little extra speed/cash. My new benchmark for merge-style games."", 'A Great Game! So much fun! At first when i downloaded it looked skeptical and confusing thinking about how hard it would be to get more dogs but when i got a bit far in the game, i actually enjoyed the way it was set up. Love the game, Addicting, easy and lots of funs.']",com.zepni.dog,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zepni.dog&hl=en&gl=in,2023-08-22 22:14:26.866681,in,en

This app is easy to use and has been particularly helpful for our kids as they learn to be responsible for our do too."", 'Perfect for keeping track of toileting, food, sleep etc. Easy to use and already been invaluable as an information store as well as the timings tracker.', 'Features missing: peed/pooped in place/not in place. Goal is to do it in place for as long as possible. Also should have the possibility to log wake up times since it is hard to determine when puppy fell asleep', ""This is a great app and it helped me train my puppy in 3 days and it's really easy to use and super usefull. Also you can when they pee,poo,sleep,play and it's super useful."", 'I love keeping track of my puppies day. However, I wish we could share our schedule for free with at least one other person. And you cannot add reminders unless you pay extra.', ""So far great. Hopefully the free version doesn't have a limit of days/years to record my pup's daily adventures."", 'Just what I wanted for keeping track of time spent in crate and training. Strongly considering purchasing premium', 'Really helped me with my new puppies needs especially toilet training and feeding. Is great for keeping track of growth and weight gain', 'Awesome app! Doggy time is absolutely genius and I have so enjoyed using it! It improves communication with the whole family and helps us see where our puppy is holding. This app helps us divide tasks efficiently between family members. Slight glitch when I transferred to a new phone. Customer support were extremely helpful!', 'It is a big help to know when the dogs have done everything. Also so we do not feed them too much.', ""It's really quick and easy to press a button to log something. It's especially easy when you have puppy brain. Exporting the logs to CSV is essential for sharing with the vet. The new smart features that tell you to pee them after drinking is excellent. I hope to see more like this. You don't need an app like this all the time but for a new puppy, logging is essential when their bladders only last a half hour. The dev responded in about a minute when I had a problem, fixed it right away."", ""I had more than a year of data in the app. Today I was asked to provide my name and email address to continue using the app. Once I entered their code for verification in the app, all my data disappeared. I'm pretty pissed! WTH happened?"", ""Was unable to unlock the subscription after purchase. Had a difficult time getting in touch with developer for help. Ultimately they helped me and got everything working. I've since upgraded my phone and the app is no longer working. Every time I try to log in it sends me an email with a verification code. When I put the verification code in it tells me that the verification code is not valid. The idea of the app is great but it's not worth all the issues you have to deal with just to use it."", 'It seems to be the best fit of any of the apps for a new puppy, although there are plenty of bugs. *When you click on your pet, and at the bottom there is a list of things like feeding, watering, walking, etc., you can edit what shows up as an option at the end. If I go to the Setting there, and unclick anything there, It won\'t remove any of the options like it says, and will only turn themselves back on. Rearranging shows you this, because when you move things, it turns options back on as well. Sharing with my husband was difficult as well, but I somehow fumbled around enough for it to work. Invite did not work, and ""signing in"" using the same email with a same or his name did not work either. I do not think the Whatsapp text worked. I am unsure if sharing over Airdrop and opening it was what did it, but somehow we got it working. Maybe integrating a password would assist the sharing function? *=edited for better description of problems', ""I bought this app after I wound up with 2 puppies to help keep track of them. It's a little difficult to keep up with them and accurately record everything, but I'm trying. The app is great but there are a few things I would tweak: -New action types: exercise pen, free time -Also wish the data was presented in a better, more useful manner. We have a weird sleep schedule so we have to flip between two days to check the total hours of play and sleep. All in all, it's useful and worth the price 👍"", ""Do not purchase the paid version, it's useless. I started using the free version and was happy with it. Then my husband and I decided to get the paid version so we could both add entries to the activity section and keep track of our puppies progress, but whenever either of us adds something, the other 1 is unable to see what was added (even after syncing), so the app doesn't work as intended at all. I basically have the same thing I had with the free version, except I'm now $8 dollars poorer."", ""I really like this app. It's the only app I have found that has so many tracking options which is very helpful. That in itself will keep me using this app. The only thing I'd like to see is a more concise way to see the data by activity/day. It's hard to just look at a long list of activities and the progress graph with all the activities shown by color isn't very useful as I'm not so concerned with how many times our pup has done something but would like to quickly see what time she did it."", ""Absolutely excellent app for new puppy owners. When there's 3 or 4 of us all looking after the puppy, trying to remember who did what, at what time if can be a nightmare, especially with a bit of sleep depravation thrown in. Doggy Time has simplified that to a tee. I paid for it almost immediately, as its so useful. Running on two Samsung and one iPhone, we've only had one issue so far, where a log with a photo (Eat) didnt appear in all timelines. Deleted pic and it synced fine. Love it."", ""Love this app! It is a very quick way to track accidents, potty break times, eating times, and health markers. It also gives me reminders so I don't forget to feed my pup. I was using an excel sheet before this and manually entering the time was a hassle. It does glitch every now and then for like 1 second when you first open it, but I think that is mainly from trying to load all of your information."", 'Definitely a good step forward. Easy to use and seems to be well thought out. No ads is awesome. Would support development. Wishing it would go directly to the dog if you only have one dog. Sometimes logs of out (Error) for no reason. Wish the date picker would go straight to hours and minutes with the option to change the date instead of forcing date pick to change the time. Wish it would auto end sleep when new activity is recorded. Wish for data export and chat log!', ""Overall, this is a great app that has made it super easy to track our puppy's day-to-day, which has made a big difference for her and us! The only annoying thing about it is that it takes a minute (literally sometimes) to load activities if my husband added something, which can lead to confusion and double logging. Sometimes I even have to restart the app. Really hope that improves because otherwise it's great."", ""I paid for subscription to be able to share my dog's records with his behaviourist. Unfortunately the share function doesn't work at all. I've contacted the developer so fingers crossed they resolve this otherwise I'll be cancelling at the end of the free trial."", 'Update: The support team contacted me and resolved the issue for me after I posted the review. 5 star. ---original comment---- It was great until I switched to a new phone, pixel 6a, and I could no longer log in and use the subscription features while I am still paying for the sub. All the data I recorded in the app for my puppy is no longer accessible to me. I tried to contact them in the app multiple times and sent an email but got no response yet. I guess I will have to cancel my sub.', 'Reports are a bit useless. Like the weight chart shows a count of how many time you recorded a weight rather than the actual weights. Annual subscription cost of $24 is a bit pricey for what is offered. Maybe a one time fee. Free optio. Is good for like a dozen entries and then you have to pay so hard to get any real feeling of the value especially when using it to track initial potty training. I just resorted to a white board.', ""This is a fantastic app for anyone with a new puppy or pet in general. Very user friendly interface and clean design. Plenty of pet activities to keep track of and once you get enough data the heat map is great for seeing your dog's habits. The full version that allows two users to track the same pet independently is fantastic and well worth the money, worth noting that only one users needs to have the full version for the sharing function to work."", ""Great app so far! Has really helped us keep track of how our pup is doing. Love the ability to add my husband so he can help keep track as well. Not sure if it is user error but the progress timeline calculation for sleep doesn't seem to be correct which is important for me for our little puppy. I will see if resyncing helps. It would be great if in the future there were widget capabilities to quickly add activities from your phone's home screen!"", ""Great app, giving only 4 stars just because it's lacking a very important feature for me: being able to calculate a day-by-day and total average of the time that passes between specific events. For example, it would be super useful to be able to determine how much time passes between drinking and peeing on average. If that feature is ever added this becomes a fully deserved 5 stars app"", ""Progress chart doesn't update properly. Considering switching to another app which has less features, but at least they work."", ""Update: This app was fantastic. However, I recently switched phones and have had trouble accessing the app. I have been trying for several months to get back into my subscription, and the management team has been utterly useless in making this work. I pay $5/month for the features and can't even get a message back to help me login. I was really enjoying everything about this app, but the lack of customer service from a team I'm paying $5/mo is horrifying. Would recommend finding a different app."", ""I really like the app, its a really useful way to track our new puppy's sleep, pee and poop intervals and for us, to keep to his schedule better. With the premium version, its way easier with my fiancé to keep track of everything together. ALTHOUGH, my only issue is with the notifications, some go through and others wont and other times, a bunch of them will pop up as i open the app so. Still, Highly recommend it."", 'Super easy to log potty training info, eating times, accidents, literally just about everything you could think of or need. You can even set reminders for everything including feeding times and medication, as well as other important routines. The best part is that both my husband and I have the app, and we are able to have all the info synced between our phones so that each of us can add information throughout the day. (Great when one of us is at work and the other is taking care of the puppy!)', 'Great app, makes most of what I want to do for tracking my puppy very simple. Would love if there were a web version, if the time format followed system settings, and there was an easier way to log ""nap started"", ""nap ended"" than by going into the sleep item and changing the end time. Oh, and the fact that the app stops working unless you buy a subscription after 20 events with no warning is pretty annoying.']",app.kidplay.doggytime,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.kidplay.doggytime&hl=en&gl=in,2023-08-22 22:14:32.022581,in,en

being able to have a game where I can take care of them, even though I can't have one. The only things I noticed, are the adds get too frequent the longer you play it, and it is hard to control the dogs on the obstacle course. Just remember game developers, the more adds there is, the more irritating it gets for people, and the more it takes the joy out of the game. Knowone wants to see adds that much."", ""I loved this game as a kid, so running across it again, I decided it may be fun to download it. But it's so glitchy now. I haven't been in game for more than an hour and it's getting annoying. I can't play with them the dogs in my yard. It won't let me click on them, or even call them back inside. Once they're outside, the buttons all grey out. I also can't pet them usually, for some reason? The hitboxes seem kind of weird, I guess. And they also take some weird turns and clip sometimes."", ""This game is very addicting. I highly reccomend this game to people who love animals. Even though there are only dogs, it's still fine. Sometimes the dogs and frisbees go through the fence.. but I get it cause' it's hard to animate and plus that's def better then I would do. Also the graphics are really good and the dogs are so cute!

Too repetitive and boring."", ""My game malfunctions a lot the dust pan and brush froze in place and my game crashed. and I checked which level I had to open the next kennel and the thing froze and I had to restart the game and every thing froze.

I use the same tricks on my dog and it works. I honestly recommend this game and it only works in your Wi-Fi so yeah there is a lot of ads but it's so good.

But seriously I\'m a teenager and I really would appreciate more dogs. 3-4 dogs the same breed isn\'t enough. Really said you have to buy these ""other"" dogs. I love this game but seriously add some more stuff like maybe a dress up competition or a dog race (after training in the obstacle course). Hope you do these and maybe I\'ll rate it 5 stars. Thank you TIVOLA!', ""I enjoy this game, it's a good time killer and the dogs are cute. However, I'm wondering if you can unlock other dog breeds (Husky, Australian Shepherd, etc) naturally through gameplay, or only using real money? I really hope there are other options, as they're some of my favorite breeds! I'm already on level 19 and only get the starter breeds."", ""Such a cute fun game, however there's a lot of glitches! There's times where I'll fill the bowl with food and the dog will just aimlessly walk around their enclosure. Also the fitness training gets really old after a while! Maybe shorten the course?"", ""Great game guys! I have to say you've really made it have good grafics! One thing is... I got a Dog and she wouldnt go back to her owner, she had her training and everything and she still wouldnt leave! Then she took over the place and no more owners came to place their dogs. I waited 3 days for this to end but it didn't, no other dogs came nor did the other dog leave, so i only had 2 choises delete the game or reinstall it. So i reinstalled the game and i got the same dog back strait after my first 2. Plz fix dis and I'll get the game bac! On the other hand good game!😃"", 'Lots of bugs...when I enter the obstacle coarse it crashes sometimes and when I enter the sniffing thingy it glitches into the main menu. Please fix these, this is a great game. - Marilyn. ❤️', '5 stars! This game is fun and cute, but I think this game needs something to add like I could take the dogs on a walk! Or a playroom or vet room for the baby dogs if we get them, and the baby dogs stay extra longer! Anways good game! :)', ""It's a decent and easy game, but it does get very repetitive. The overall game could benefit from more regular updates and more new things, like new training methods, or just new ideas in general."", ""All the games from Tivola run about the same; meaning the feeding, care, etc. That makes all their games fun and easy to use! I enjoy this very much. There's so much personality in the different dogs. Its low stress and wonderful fun!!"", 'My friend told me about the game so i though i would try it and i love it, its easy to play and you can get the cutest dogs ever, you can build your hotel bigger and better. So the people who are reading this well why are you still reading, go install doghotel.', ""I love this game u may ask why? Well my dream was to open a dog kinda kennel/rescue thing and i saw this game and im like o my gosh i have to try this and i did and i play this game everyday now and i don't need to open that kennel/rescue because i have it right here! I highly recomend this game very fun and its just a big adventure i would love to see different training things and some new breeds of dogs but most of all i love this game JUST LIKE MINECRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"", ""I think that dog hotel is amazing but I can't stop thinking and thinking why I put my dogs outside and they NEVER come back in. 🤔But there isn't many ads my dogs are healthy and happy and that's all I need so to rap it up I love this game a few glitches here and there but it's fine I hope I have been a help so thx😉"", ""It's a fun wholesome game where you can play, teach, and take care of many different breeds of dogs. To me, I love everything about this! I would like it if you added a second new one that's connected to this one. 😎"", ""I just started playing and I find that it's a very cute game. There's only one problem that I've found so far: brushing and petting the dogs is very unresponsive. It would also be nice if we had a checklist of what we need to do."", ""The dog's are fun and the activities are great but the controls are not very accurate and they play a bad after every action ie wash dog then video play with dogs watching another video it takes the fun out of the game. I understand that the developer needs to make money especially since the game is free to play but let us play for like 5-10 minutes then a ad not 15-30 seconds"", 'Exercise mini game make it unplayable. After the 2nd obstacle the dog will run around in all directions and totally miss the rest of the course. It is same in the premium version too.', 'I love this game! Its really cute and dogs galore! But if you are picky about how smooth animations are than you may get uncomfotable, so if you can, try to work on dog animations a bit, but if i knew how, i would have given this game a 4.5 out if 5', 'I deleted my previous review due to excitement for ""a new doggy game"". Please do not take offense, but please update this game. I love this game its awesome but seeing the same dog breeds kinda gets boring. There\'s only a few dog breeds on this game in the pictures that this app published,i saw different breeds. So please when you are updating this game add new dog breeds. That\'s the only flaw of this game... Otherwise it\'s a really good, relaxing, lovely game. Thank you', ""This game is okay but I've been playing and my dog will not move and I'm just waiting for the dog to do something but it'll just stand there drooling so yeah I would like to make some improvements on that because I don't know what to do like has my dog died inside and the paper it goes in and out too fast and I can't even read it so yeah please improve that."", ""Hi I hope u guys respond I love your game however every time I exit the game for a minute and go back to it, it always goes back to five minutes ago and restarts everything I was doing you should probably add a save button because I spent $10 dollars so I can't delete the game please respond and tell me what to do."", 'This game is very amusing and a time killer but do you think you could add a border collie and a fox hound. And can you add the debug menu back because the menu helps me alot. Do ya think you can do that?🤔👍', ""I love this game very much because it is so cute but I just have one question how do you give baths and train animals because my second animal needs to be trained and I can't figure out how to do that so otherwise I think this is a awesome game.▼・ᴥ・▼"", 'Love it! Theres a wide variety of dogs and the graphics are amazing and i dont even care about the ads, anyways, this game is amazing!!!!', ""Too many adds! In this game you have to do activities with the dogs like play with them, wash them, train and exercise. Each thing is quick to do - and after EVERY activity there's a long add! You literally spend as much time watching adds as playing the game. Uninstalled."", ""It isn't a bad game. I didnt get very far into it. Took care of about 6 dogs and enjoyed that each had something different to take care off. So I got to do something new. It was just a bit slow and didnt keep my interest very long. For that reason I gave it a neutral rating.""]",com.tivola.doghotel,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tivola.doghotel&hl=en&gl=in,2023-08-22 22:14:33.927338,in,en

audio all of a sudden has stopped working after updating google meet. Kindly look into this issue as it's getting frustrating for me to access the meeting facilities properly. I had informed it earlier but no reponse yet received. I have to reboot my system every single time for resolving this technical issues. It's seriously frustrating! Kindly resolve this issue as soon as possible. Thank you."", ""I love it. Better than WhatsApp in video quality and audio clarity. Then there are numerous features which depends on how one would want to use it. Overall very satisfied. Not sure if all devices are supported. I had trouble making video calls from my Samsung device as the other person didn't receive my call. The other person was using a Pixel device, that keratin made a video call that i was able to receive and connect."", ""It's a very good app, particularly for online meetings and classes. There's one problem with the app that it doesn't work properly with blue tooth speaker, the sound quality and volume, both are not very good with blue tooth speaker. This limits it's usage particularly for classes that require kinesthetic movements like dance, exercise and yoga. Can you please fix this problem?"", ""Good call quality. Biggest problem is when I call my home devices, it would not give me options to show myself or not. Always makes calls as a video calls. Sometimes I just want phone calls, not a video calls. Another is that u just can't make calls to any number. It has to be a registered number in the Google meet. These two need big improvements. They always make things very complicated w most of their products"", ""BEWARE! DON'T DOWNLOAD. It came preloaded on my Samsung S2don't want this app! I can't delete it. When I change the auto-uprate feature in the GooglePlay store to off, it automatically changes it back to allow auto-updates. Can't change permissions/unwarranted authority over my phone in settings. Uses data/wifi/storage/battery. Once it's there, you'll never be able to get rid of it. 0 stars if I could."", 'This app was my go-to for video calls for a long time, but the last week or so, it keeps giving me ""unexpected error"" and ""problem starting call"". I looked up ways to correct it, which included clearing the cache, clearing app data, and reinstalling the app. It will work for the first call, and then mess up again every single time I do the bug-fixes. Hopefully, there is a way to permanently correct this or some kind of patch update.', ""It works really good on full bars for Internet. However, when I get down to 3 bars it glitches then 2 bars it freezes video. Then I loose sound on the last bar. I think it should work better when it shows I do still have Internet at all. Haven't figured out how to send text messages. It hasn't worked for me, yet. Other than that I like MEET. 👍"", ""I am very pleased with this video app, although I hope you can get a higher definition of quality for the video picture on both ends of the screen. Also, the more special effects, filters, backgrounds, and extras are so much fun and useful in a lot of different ways. Keep up the awesome upgrades! Can't wait for the next new surprises to come ♡♡"", ""Update: it still is not any better. I did send feedback through the three little dots on meet app. I'm having problems with the picture being fuzzy freezing up. echos when I talk and they are unable to understand me or me them. Can you please look at that. I love the way the app was before. And since we do a lot of face-to-face talking through this app it's really a bummer."", ""My partner and I are long distance and have a tendency to go to sleep on call. Despite the fact that we both have full wifi, there have been several occasions where we wake up and the call has ended. Neither of us ended the call, neither of our phones updated, and neither of our apps needed to be updated. Besides that the quality of the calls can be extremely inconsistent, fine one second, grainy, hard to see or hear to frozen video another second. It's inconsistent and just bad."", 'It\'s ok for a video chat app. Main problem is that there isn\'t a button to use the phone speaker. Only Bluetooth on/off, so sound comes out of the phones earpiece only and I can barely hear the other person. The filters are fun, but there\'s just not a lot of what I think are ""useful"" features. Sometimes I use the children\'s coloring feature as a whiteboard. There\'s no like chat or share features, but not too hard to swap over to text for that. Just an ok app at best, beside that one major issue.', ""This has been the most glitchy app I have ever used. I wouldn't expect that coming from Google. If there is a dip in service and it drops the call, I have to restart my phone and not just the app. Half the time, it doesn't hang up and it keeps the call connected while not allowing other calls to come in. My phone is super hot any time I use it. Do better Google"", ""It was really nice to be able to call with my freinds and family with a face to face experience. I personally have an android so it is one of the only ways I can see freinds and family. The filters and the settings were a bit slow and sometimes didn't load at all, which is a minor issue. Overall, a really good idea, the execution needs some minor adjustments but nothing that won't stop you from conversing woth others."", ""When recording videos, now meet automatically lowers the volume of apps that are open. I try recording videos while YouTube music played in the background and it automatically lowers the volume. Also, when this was duo, we were able to zoom in while recording videos and we can no longer do that. Please give us the option to enable these 2 features. I'm in the car audio community so letting my volume while I'm recording videos is really annoying."", ""It's a nice app. You can exit out of the app without it kicking you out of the call and there's a share screen option which is nice. But sometimes the audio is pretty bad. Like, I was on a call with my friend and when she said something, a constant beeping sound would play. It was really annoying. And I wish you were able to mute people. Sometimes I'm in big group calls and it's hard to hear others when everyone else was talking."", ""The app interface is simple and good looking. I'll be at. I wish the buttons were material you themed also this is the only app I have any issues with the white balance. Quite often the camera blows out and I look like Voldemort and considering this is the only app that does it, it's clearly an issue with the software other than those gripes it's a great app"", ""It works fine most of the time but sometimes it freezes so much. Even if both users of the call are on full wifi and everything it will glitch and freeze really bad. For long distance relationships and stuff this is a huge inconvenience. It has a lot of trouble connecting sometimes and it won't always show when someone is calling me. These major issues that make the app almost useless sometimes need to be fixed as soon as possible."", 'Updated review: Meet has made some improvements since my last review. Any improvement is welcomed. That said some very basic functions are still missing. Receiving pictures can be difficult if you want to save or copy them. Being able to send or receive notes and or pictures while on an active meet voice call is also missing. Sharing usable hyperlinks is also missing. These simple functions are why nearly all of my colleagues have left the platform. The platform has a lot of potential.', ""I've been able to use Meet for audio calls using my Google Mini, Google Nest Display (w/o camera), and video calls using a couple of my phones. I've been able to share photos while in video calls without having to send a separate text message, and the sound has been good I was shocked that the Assistant heard me from a different room than it was in to make a call for me. I am having a problem getting it to connect to my TVs. I'm not sure if available on my Windows 11 laptop yet, but hope so"", 'When it was Duo, everything was great. Now I have problems with the volume as it only lowers to a certain point that is still to loud. Also, the brightness does not adjust like it used to. It used to adjust in full darkness for me and the person I was calling. Now it just plunges us into the abyss without any adjustment. I cannot figure out how to fix these after going through absolutely everything.', ""I don't know what happened in the last couple of months but I can no longer make calls in this app because I can't verify my phone number. I have tried every step on the help page (force stop, uninstall and reinstall, update phone, restart) multiple times but still nothing. The only thing I use it for is video calls so it's now useless to me."", ""I liked duo because it did what I needed. Some of us use Android and some of us use iphone. For the most part it works except when it doesn't, but I think it more my connection. The other thing I don't like is that I cannot change the sound to let me know someone is calling. I barely hear it and miss calls because of that. I try to report the problem but never know if anyone gets it and I NEVER get a response. Gabi"", ""Hasn't worked since the update. I use this app frequently, and it's tuning into an inconvenience. I go in the app, dial the call, and it just beeps. I was able to answer once, but it never actually opened the call. I have cleared all caches, deleted and reinstalled the app, restarted my phone, nothing."", ""I couldn't get any of the calls to connect for over a year. I don't know what happened when it changed from Duo to Meet but that was the last time I used it until now 8/8/23. I erased it and reinstalled it multiple times but still wouldn't work. I had to resort to Facebook Messenger which always worked but the quality of the video calls were hit or miss. I tried Meet today and it worked and was clear. I just hope that it continues to work like it did today, because I prefer it over any other app"", ""With so many folks caught up in the rat race I think this app is pointless for the most part. There's too many other platforms (usually preloaded on one's device) for use in business and personal affairs. I agree, it's nice to be able to sync a virtual meeting with my email and what not, but sometimes feel overwhelmed with all the Google apps where so much of our personal information is shared."", 'There should be an option for users to change ring tones and notification tones. Besides the ringing not being loud, I need to know which app a call is coming from. By changing the ringtone, I mean having the ability to customize the ringtone with music of my choice. Additionally, when a contact number is opened in the default phone caller, only the video call option is available. There should also be a direct voice option available for contacts saved in the default phone book.', ""Great app. I can stay in touch with my hubby with video when he is out of town working. Thanks Duo. I changed my rating for meet because it keeps shutting down. Get video for one second then disappears. Will not stay on, on my Samsung. Can't Uninstall and reinstall. Updated and still doesn't work. Help"", ""Disappointed 😞! While in a meet, the notification that's showing join and left makes it difficult to exit full screen. And I have waited for half an hour to exit the full screen. After that I found about the long press . So for a newcomer it's so difficult. and it would be a great if you guys can rectify this issue.."", ""So much better than facetime! We live in the country and have poor internet service. This uses bandwidth much better than FT. Almost no buffering ever when FT won't connect from the same locations. But this app used to be much easier to use when it was DUO. I try to get people to use it but the I vacation set up and first call is seems VERY challenging for people to do. I wonder why Google improved it so badly?!!!"", 'The setting for disabling noise cancellation keeps appearing and dissappearing for me. I am so distressed because of this. This is making me drop out of music classes 🥺 Edit 1: I dont see an option of update on play store. So, I am on latest version. I have tried removing cache and storage after stopping the app, and then uninstalling it and installing it afresh. Still dont see a section of audio settings (under which noise cancellation option appears) under my settings.', 'Video constantly switches from wifi to data because of weak signal, but signal is actually strong at 450Mbps. I have to turn my phone to airplane mode to use it. If I start the call on Bluetooth and switch off my headphones the volume is very low and I need to restart the call. Recently there also is an audio delay so conversations are difficult. The app has been unusable because of these things. Previous versions worked fine. This has only been the past few updates.', ""Google Duo(Meet),is very clear,with excellent sound quality.It even has evolved better than expected.We use it for family communications,it's certainly very trustworthy,and the simplicity is superb. The support team is also very involved in improvements.5 stars for this App is deserving, against fierce competition, thank you."", ""I had to edit my review: For weeks now, I have had constant interruptions during video calls. The person I am talking to can no longer see me and I receive a message that my camera is not available. In addition, the call notification is very unreliable, sometimes even the notification about a missed call is missing. I use the Pixel 7 Pro, so I am particularly irritated by the app's lack of interaction with the phone. In the meantime, I have switched to WhatsApp in frustration."", ""It works as well as any other video call app. I don't like the video pre-call screen though. It shows your selfie camera full screen in the background and it looks like I'm already in an active video call or that I'm leaving a video-mail message. I would like it if I could easily distinguish my call status. A flashing red dot or red scrolling/flashing marquee banner across the top of the screen clearly stating the call status, either that you're in a call or that it's ready to make a call. 🎭🎫"", 'This being Google I am very disappointed especially when on some devices it is the built-in video calling app used and can\'t be uninstalled. Zoom or similar better performing apps should be studied for ""Meet"" improvements. Samsung uses this built-in app for communication instead of their original which was much better in all ways. Since this is a built-in Com App, it may be time Google put this app on top of the list for super impressive improvements.', ""Sometimes the call will have really bad audio but it's fixed whenever you hang up and call again. Otherwise the app works pretty well. I'm not sure where to put a feature request, but I would like to request a way to lock the screen so that my toddler can't swipe away from the call while he's holding the phone talking to people. Edit: thanks Google for the response. I have a Pixel 7."", ""Another absolutely trash phone application for googles own operating system. You cannot minimize yourself at all. I have a folding phone and my own face takes up half the screen when I fold the phone to get a good angle. It's still very bad design and must be intended for narcissists that can't deal with not seeing themselves."", ""It is great for video calls and I use it daily. However, there's a forced after-call screen that pops up once I end a call that I made which is extremely annoying. I am quickly moving on to an important notification which made me end the call but I have to see the screen again and then go back to my notification which is the last thing I need in emergencies."", '7/5/2023-I have done all the steps that were mentioned & the app is still not working like it was when myself & 2 additional people are on Meet. The sound is terrible & the picture freezes. I do not have this issue when it is myself & 1 other person. Any other suggestions? Just updated app, can communicate clearly w/ 1 person. However, when trying to connect w/2 people, they can not hear me, and I can not hear them. I can only see them. The app worked fine prior to this last update. Please fix.', ""Terrible quality calls. Doesn't know how to register a Bluetooth signal. Randomly dropped calls. Vibrations that don't end even after picking up the call and closing the app. All around a pretty terrible app experience, and genuinely makes me consider buying apple just so I dont have to deal with this.""]",com.google.android.apps.tachyon,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tachyon&hl=en&gl=in,2023-08-22 22:14:38.779988,in,en

couple years now, it's one of the few apps that I use every single day. I'd be lost without it. There've been a few bugs along the way but they are always responsive and fixed quickly. I especially like some of the recent changes to the events like the drop-down in Medicine to specify the type. It's a lifesaver for multi-carer packs & dogs with health issues, being able to easily create a log of everything to share with the vet is priceless."", ""Fantastic app for monitoring your pet's day-to-day life. We had a cat with several health issues and DogLog allowed us to track her health and daily routine easily and effectively. As a result, we were fully prepared for vet appointments with a concise record of her progress and, in turn, the vet could provide more effective medical care for her. Highly recommend this all for any pet owner."", ""I like the app as it is very useful to be able to quickly make notes about your dog that will be organised and sorted in a nice way so you can easily go back to it. However a few things could be improved. One thing is the weight curve. The X-axis should be your pet's age, not the number increment of your measurement. If you don't weigh your pet continuously you will not see the slopes of weight gain/loss as realistic in the time dimension."", ""The application doesn't allow me to put in the breed of my dog from my profile. Also, all info I inserted got deleted the moment I pressed 'back'button even though I had saved it. I'm deleting this app and finding a working one!"", ""Great and simple way to track daily activities, as well as medications. I added my dogs exact medication by name (custom) and a few other things specific to her. I decided to get premium so I can view the usual time or day we do certain things, and it has really helped me plan out schedules. It's super easy to use and pretty inexpensive for the information you get access to."", ""It's pretty good. I've been using it for about 1 yr now. No ads everywhere and I like that I can filter by event categories. Only problem I have is that I can't delete entries when clicking the delete button. Edit button works but not delete"", ""This seems like a fairly helpful app and I love that you can share with a pack. I need to monitor blood sugar checks, urine checks, etc. You can make the categories but I really need a graph like the temp feature. I'm using a diabetic pet specific app but it is not stable. If this app grows to that level I would likely pay as the other features seem solid."", 'Any useful analytical data is locked behind a premium fee that does not justify its cost. I can do the same stuff with a free Google form and spreadsheet', 'Perfect for keeping track of toilet routines. Can adapt new icons for other things to track. Very useful', ""does exactly what I need it to: helps clear up confusion about who took the dog for a walk and when to help us avoid messy accidents and be aware of our pooch's schedule. the ONE reason this isn't 5 stars for me is the lack of dark mode because this app blinds me every night i take my dog for s walk. otherwise, perfect little simple app."", ""Love the simplicity of the interface with the option to add more activities (repeating for a common task or once, like a skunk attack!). Tracking my 11 week old puppy for the past 2 weeks has been extremely helpful. I can see patterns in what times he eats, when we go outside, when he's most likely to have an accident. would be better if you could adjust the time of the event as you are entering it instead of defaulting to current time. Slow app loading screen can be frustrating."", 'Very user friendly interface. Simple to use. The free version has enough features to get started with what appears to be paid for optional extras, which appear useful but not essential. So, you can get started for free and add the extras later, which is nice. Non-intrusive ads too. It has been very useful for us where there are six people plus two dogs in our pack, as we can each log our shared responsibilities and keep track of things. Very useful app.', 'Great app, especially for pups with multiple caregivers so you\'re not constantly texting each other ""did you walk the dog before you left?"". Intuitive and the simple interface makes it easy to add entries with one hand while being dragged along by over-enthusiastic puppies! The most recent release addressed the only two things I didn\'t like about the app.', ""The app is exactly what I look for to keep track of my pet's daily tasks. It has a simple interface that its easy to use. I can easily add more custom items according to my dog's needs. N easily edit items by pushing the task to left. I do like them to record it in current time, so i can calculate walk time, by tapping walk at the start n grooming(cleaning) at the end of the walk. I really hope the data in the app can extracted in later version so it can be presented in doctor's visit. Thanks!"", 'Great app for tracking a new puppy\'s every move. So easy to track food, weight, bowel movements, training etc. I love the option to add a photo and ""like"" or comment on everything. Also easily customize your own buttons (for example, we added ""rest"" in addition to the ""nap"" option). Overall great app that we are using as a ""pack"" with other family members who also have a new puppy.', 'This app used to be perfect. All I needed it was to log food walks and bathroom breaks. However, since my initial download several months ago they have broken every aspect of this. It has gotten to the point where I literally cannot open a dog. I have downgraded to a version of the app from 2018 and have zero issues. I have been sending crash logs regularly in hopes that they fix these problems to no avail. I will be happy to fix my rating once stability is back. Edit 11/4/19: The update to 3.8.13 has certainly fixed my stability issues but it has introduced a new problem. On the previous versions that I was using, when logging something a popup overlay would appear in the center of the screen to select the dog and write any notes. However, now it shows a redesigned full screen page. While I do like the aesthetics of this new page, it now places the dog selection and finish button at the two farthest points from your hand, at the top. With a majority of phone screens exceeding 5.5 inches this makes maintaining the leash complex. A remedy for this could be rearranging the icons to be at the bottom and placing the add a photo button at the top considering that most stabilize photos with two hands making the reach less bothersome.', ""This app is the perfect thing that we were looking for. You can create custom recurring events as buttons to reuse. We created ones for sleeping, napping, and crate time. It's really the perfect solution for tracking your dogs habits. Especially great for learning a new puppy's time between eating and eliminating, and bladder control. Thank you for creating this!"", 'Been using this app for a year, since shortly after we adopted our first cat and love it! Pretty easy to learn how it works, no obtrusive ads, and a great system for sharing access to the whole family. The only thing that could make it better to me would be the ability to hide certain actions from the ""Log Events"" screen because I don\'t plan to use some of them for kitty, such as ""water"" and ""pee"".', ""Update 1/17/23 - Suddenly cannot use the app; it won't open, despite uninsta/reinstall. :( Really like being able to log when she went potty, when she ate, etc - very helpwful if you have ADHD! I also track when we train, go for a walk, any health issues that concern me (e.g. scratching a lot), and when she takes meds. I do wish there were more icons or you could add your own, because I have to repeat them a lot for what I track because there are so few and a limited variety."", ""Good but offline issues - If you're out of the house without the internet & switch to a different app, when it goes to reload, it won't, and then when you get back home again & connect to the internet, all the information you added when out the house disappears. Just lost all the walk, pee, poop, drink, eating, treats, vet appointment logs etc I made when I was out. It's very annoying. It could at least store information on my phone to sync up later if I'm offline. I subscribe too."", ""Responsive developer. Definitely the best app available. I'm looking forward to the updates. Currently, no ability to enter time of events at initial entry. The log is confusing to read; maybe use the pet photos on the log also? Currently everything looks the same. My Swype keyboard does not work in the app. Maybe allow for a neutral note entry in the log. To keep track of weird occurrences in the pup's life."", ""This app has been very helpful to us logging three animals activities between 4 caregivers.  It's simple to use.  My only issue thus far is that when I log an activity it auto-selects every pet, and I have to unselect all, then just select one pet.  I can see where this could be handy for larger packs that do things together. However, I would love the option to set a 'default' selection - I do most activities with just one pet at a time.  Having a preset, or having none selected to start, would save me a couple steps each time."", 'I really love this app. I always end up with orphaned kittens that people bring me, and I often do the record-keeping on paper. This is even smarter. There are options for potty going and feeding. I do wish there was a way to keep records about temperature and body weight and the option to have records for cats as well as dogs. Also, a widget of some of the info would be awesome, too. Over all, it mostly filled the requirement I need in a tracking app.', 'This app allows me to customize events as well as reminders in addition to other already programmed preset options for me and gives a lot of freedom in regards to how many events and reminders you can log at a single time. When I had a question, after emailing, I recieved an answer to my question within half an hour. I may have personally needed help but I would say this app is user friendly and simple to navigate. Very happy with it.', 'Needs a lot of work. Can\'t edit/delete a record once you submit it. Can\'t mark an accident. Have to manually enter the start time twice. No ""now"" button for the end time to use it like a stopwatch; you instead have to manually input the end time. Default units are arbitrary. (e.g. for ""poop"" it defaults to a quantity of ""miles"") Back button on my phone always takes me to the dog chooser screen instead of screen I was previously on. Lack of stopwatch functionality is a deal-breaker for me', 'Was charged for the trial of the premium version. Unsubscribed immediately. Have emailed the developer asking for the money to be refunded. Waiting for a response.', ""It's such a brilliant app for keeping records of everything about you dog, especially useful if they are regularly poorly so you can easily track records."", ""Easy to add events. Would be better if you could set the time when you're adding an event, instead of having to edit it afterwards. Super for multiple people, nice notification when someone else logs an event. Statistics aren't great. I'd like to be able to visualise the time of day she's going to the toilet, and also in relation to feed time. Would be nice if the information could be exported to csv."", 'It\'s not a bad app, but it\'s crashing all the time for me. I can\'t log anything - I need to try at least 3 times before I\'m able to log anything without the app crashing on me. Also I don\'t understand why they stopped showing the weight history that we had since day 1 of us getting a puppy. For a couple of weeks it started showing only the latest logged wright event, but now it says ""No events"" logged - it\'s very upsetting :( I have the latest version of the app, but it still doesn\'t work.', ""It's good but the only downside is there doesn't seem to be an undo button would be a nice feature. EDIT - There is a way to delete! Thankyou support team that makes the app so much easier to use! 10/10! Really useful for keeping track of toilet training and I love the fact you can add other activities 👌 would absolutely reccomend this to my friends with pets particularly puppies"", ""Great app, but there is no way to edit the log entries. I made some mistakes and also want to switch the way I document the heats, but I cannot go back and edit the old entries. I would make new ones but then I would have the entry doubled, since I can't delete the old ones. I like the possibility of creating custom log categories."", 'Edit: Thanks for responding! I updated my rating. Looking forward to the new version :) . . . I wish you could delete events, edit events, and add more than three pets (I use it for my ferrets too). I also wish there was a ""vet"" option. Other than that, it serves its purpose and we\'re able to communicate when we bring her out and feed her with everyone in our household.', ""This app is AMAZING. A few small QOL things, but completely offset by how helpful it is. I'm tracking so many things for my cat who has some issues I need to keep an eye on, and this is MUCH easier than notepad. But...... Huge banner ad appeared at the top of the app today. It's very obnoxious. Still very worth it, and I 100% support them getting some income for it. I donated through the link. But maybe if you're going to go the ad route, you could have a paid ad free version? Still 5*, but 🤞?"", ""Update: They fixed the crashing issue really fast! I love this app because its really easy to log what you need to. It has a lot of features to use. However my main reason for getting an app like this is to be able to predict what time my dog will go potty. I was hoping the app would do this for me, but you have to pay $40 a year for it! I can't spend that much a year. I get that the makers of this app need money too, but I wish they would let you buy individual features without a monthly cost."", ""I really like this app so far. The only thing I'm not happy with is in the profile feed. There are some fields like breed and food brand that I would like to add for my pup, but you seem to have to select from a dropdown. Having a rescue mix, my breed is not on there and my food brand also doesn't appear in the list. I would like the option to either select Mix or Other. Otherwise a freetext input field would be much more useful."", ""Though not a dog owner, this app is the best I've found so far for tracking feeding and other necessary reminders for caring for our cats. I would love to see this expanded to include other animal breeds!!! My only downfalls, again not a dog owner but a pet owner who needs to keep track of pet health, are that some of the profile details don't have the option to be written in (food, breed, etc.). Also, I would like to be able to delete some of the activities that I do not use (i.e. outdoor activities). Again, this app would be PERFECT if it included other animal types as well!"", ""This app has helped me so much with tracking everything my new puppy. It had made potty training so much easier! One of the best free apps I've tried!"", ""Exactly what we needed for our new puppy. Especially if one person is taking over responsibilities during the night, morning, work hours, etc., we can easily see what happened and when to anticipate the upcoming events.The only thing we wish we could figure out is how to share reminders with the whole pack. Right now it looks like it's only visable to the person creating the reminders, but we are using this feature to set upcoming vaccinations, etc. and want the whole pack to get the reminders."", 'Briefly, overall, it gets the job done. But important things just arent options. We play ALOT more then we walk but there is no button for, ""play"". Each picture needs to be really small which sucks. I take many pics that I cannot send. There\'s no place in the feed to write a simple written update. I have to send 2 long texts during the day to give a more detailed update. The caption with each activity has to be under 7ish words. I could write a lot more. Definitely could be better IMO...', ""It's a nice app with a clean interface. I like being able to track things about my puppy's health. However, the biggest downside to me is that I can't seem to find a way to edit or delete log entries. I wanted to add notes to a log after I made it, but I haven't found a way to edit it and I can't delete it and recreate the log with notes. This seems like a major feature that is completely missing. No options to work around this defect as far as I can tell.""]",com.mobikode.dog,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobikode.dog&hl=en&gl=in,2023-08-22 22:14:40.349498,in,en
