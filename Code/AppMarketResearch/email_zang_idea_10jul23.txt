SUBJECT: Dissertation project idea from future student.

BODY:

Dear Prof. Zang,

Hope this email finds you well.

I am a student enrolled in the MSc. Computer Science (Data Science) program offered by Trinity College Dublin (TCD) for the academic year 2023 - 24. Currently residing in Abu Dhabi UAE, I'm hoping to be at campus this September. Your email address was sourced from the very helpful webinar held for us MSc. Computer Science students by TCD on 14 June 2023.
Given my experience from BSc. (Hons.) Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University, I understand that finding a good dissertation project that can be executed in the given time frame is challenging. Since Bachelors was a 4 year journey, we had plenty of time to figure out our final year dissertation which I had started thinking about by the end of year 3. Because Masters is only one year, I have begun some web (and soul) searching now. Ideally, I'd like to have a basic dissertation idea/topic ready in mind before I'm there at TCD.

I am reaching out to you via this email to present an idea that I think could be a potential data science project, however; I'm certain you'd be a better judge of this. So, please find attached, a short pdf document with the idea and motivation briefly stated. It would be much appreciated if you could kindly skim over this document, and share your opinion on whether this could be a data science dissertation project at TCD please.

Eagerly awaiting your valuable advice/insights.

Thank you for your time,
Gayathri Girish Nair.
