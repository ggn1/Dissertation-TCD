To convert numbers from one range $[x, y]$ to another $[a, b]$, a linear transformation as given below can be used. $$ y = \frac{(x - a) \times (d - c)}{b - a} + c $$Here:
* $x$ is the number on the original scale.
* $y$ is the corresponding number on the new scale.
* $a$ and $b$ are the minimum and maximum values of the original scale.
- $c$ and $d$ are the minimum and maximum values of the new scale.
