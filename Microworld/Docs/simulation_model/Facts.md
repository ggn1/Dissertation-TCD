## CO2 Concentration & The Carbon Cycle
$$
CO_2 \text{ ppm} = \frac{V_c}{V_a}\times10^6
$$
Here, $V_c =$ volume of $CO_2$ $(m^3)$ and $V_a=$ volume of air $(m^2)$.

[(S. Rackley, Science Direct, 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/global-carbon-cycle)

Given weight of carbon in the air and the volume of the atmosphere, the concentration of $CO_2$ in $PPM$ can be computed as demonstrated in [[CO2 Concentration]].

<font color="#88dd99">Photosynthesis is more effective at CO2 concentrations ranging from 700 to 1800 with around 1000 being max efficiency.

<font color="#88dd99">By weight, dried tree material is about 50 % carbon.</font> [(US Department of Agriculture)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/Forest-Carbon-FAQs.pdf)

Following is an example computation of how much $CO_2$ a tree absorbs. [(Ecotree)](https://ecotree.green/en/how-much-co2-does-a-tree-absorb)
* Let weight of a tree be 1000 kg with 100% humidity.
* Around 50% of the tree is dry mass.
* Then, this tree is approximately 500 kg dry mass and 500 kg water.
* Approximately 47.5% of that dry mass is carbon. So, weight of carbon in this tree = 237.5 kg.
* Based on molar masses of carbon (12), oxygen (16), and consequently $CO_2$ (44) it can be arrived at that it takes 3.67 kg of $CO_2$ to create 1 kg of C.
* Thus, this tree has absorbed $237.5 \times 3.67 = 871.63 \text{ kg}$ of $CO_2$.
* Let the age of this tree be 35 years. Then, the amount of $CO_2$ it as absorbed per year $\approx 25$ kg.

## Tree Growth

The relationship between diameter growth and height growth of a tree, in nature, is non-linear because either growth rates seems to depend on different variables and non-linear models capture trends better than linear ones [(A. Sumida, 2015)](https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article/35/10/1031/2364703?login=true). 

Although subject to significant variability, a good estimate of a relationship between Height and Diameter of a tree is $H \propto D^{2/3}$. [(X. Chen and D. Brockway, 2017)](https://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jps/article/view/69956) [(D. Brockway, 2017)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/news/highlights/relationship-between-tree-height-and-diameter-consistent-across-species-and-ranges) Accounting for a proportionality constant, this may be written as $H = kD^{2/3}$. For simplicity, $k$ may be set to 1, implying a direct relationship without any scaling effect due to the environment, species of tree, etc. Thus, in this microworld the relationship between tree height and diameter is, $H_t = D_t^{2/3} \Rightarrow D_t = H_t^{3/2}$. Often, Height is expressed in meters and Diameter in centimetres.

## Forest Composition

The average size of a privately owned forest in Ireland is 8 hectares. [(SWS Forestry)](https://swsforestry.ie/why-plant/forestry-facts/)

[(Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Ireland)](https://assets.gov.ie/267876/499d9f21-751b-4d53-89d6-ed8e8e9efb97.pdf)
Forests in Ireland as per NFI, 2022, is composed of 61.2% conifers and 27.0% broad leaves.

[(T. Kuuluvainen et al., 2002)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280265636_Tree_age_distributions_in_old-growth_forest_sites_in_Vienansalo_wilderness_eastern_Fennoscandia)
* Distribution of age and type of trees in an old growth forest in Vienansalo Wilderness, Eastern Fennoscandia is as follows. 
![[old_growth_forest_composition.png]]

* Total no. of trees = 725.
* 450 Coniferous + 155 Deciduous = 605 trees.
* Max age of trees in the real old growth forest is different from that in the microworld. In the real world, the oldest coniferous tree was 525 years old while the oldest deciduous tree was 162 years old. In the microworld, the oldest coniferous tree would be 100 years old and the oldest deciduous tree would be 80 years old. So, to be able to map the composition of the real forest to the microworld, there is a need for [[Range Conversion]].

For every 1 pound of wet, living wood, about 55 to 60 percent is dry wood (that is, cells) and 40 to 45 percent is water. [(E. M. Wengert, 1998)](https://woodweb.com/knowledge_base/Water_and_Wood.html)

## Height to Diameter Ratio (HDR)
* $\text{coniferous}=600:6\text{ to }3700:57\text{ cm}\Rightarrow 2150:31.5\approx 68:1\approx1:0.015$ [(T. Nord-Larsen and A. T. Nielsen, 2015)](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Diameter-and-height-allometry-of-the-6-conifer-species-and-236-trees-included-in-this_fig2_274265546)
* $\text{deciduous}=300:4.456\text{ to }1000:22.28\text{ cm}\Rightarrow650:13=50:1=1:0.02$ [(Deepdale)](https://www.deepdale-trees.co.uk/trees/technical-info.html)

## Ecosystem Services
* In Ireland, PES 4 Environmental Enhancement grants worth €150/ha/yr applies where a high ecological priority has been identified. [(Teagasc)](https://www.teagasc.ie/crops/forestry/grants/native-woodland-conservation-scheme-2023-2027/)
* Ireland Forestry Programme 2023-2027 [(Irish Farmers Association)](https://www.ifa.ie/forestry-programme-2023-2027/)

## Timber
* In 2020, cost of wood could be around $325 = €300 per cord, each weighing around 1 ton = 1e+6 grams. Thus, selling price per g = €0.0003 and consequently, that per kg = €0.3. [(Blair Korchinski Quora, 2020)](https://www.quora.com/How-much-does-a-ton-of-wood-cost)
* Cost of felling a tree is dependent on various factors such as size, location and species. Here, let us only consider size. On average, in a city like Dublin, the average cost of felling a tree can range from €400 to €3000. [(Grasshopper Services)](https://www.grasshopperservices.ie/tree-removal-cost/)
* The average cost for planting a tree is between $150 and $1,850, with a national average cost of $300. [(A. Nita, 2023)](https://lawnlove.com/blog/cost-to-plant-tree/)
## Forest Recreation
* [(Department of Agriculture and Food Ireland, 2006)](file:///C:/Users/g_gna/Downloads/237574_9feddf62-69dd-40b5-b49e-c0aa2e35b7f6.pdf) [(K. Mayor et. al., 2007)](https://www.esri.ie/system/files?file=media/file-uploads/2015-07/WP190.pdf)
* There are multiple funds available for construction and maintenance of infrastructure to enable forest recreational activities. A good approximation of no. of visitors to a forest per year = 147340  [(Coillte, 2022)](file:///C:/Users/g_gna/Downloads/262263_3600f311-dbd4-4342-804d-83f0b4e74b26.pdf)
* Visits to Irish forests are estimated to be over 29 million visits per annum. [(Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine, 2022, Ireland Forest Statistics)](https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/crops/forestry/advice/Forest-Statistics-Ireland-2022.pdf)
* The total forest area has increased from 697,842 ha in 2006 to 808,848 ha in 2022. [(Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, 2022, Ireland National Forest Inventory)](file:///C:/Users/g_gna/Downloads/246991_0b1fafb5-9475-4955-bbbc-26bd9effb509-3.pdf)
* Building and maintaining forest trails can be costly [(National Trails Office, 2012)](https://www.sportireland.ie/sites/default/files/2019-10/a_guide_to_planning_and_developing_recreational_trails_in_ireland.pdf).
* In 2006, restoration of a forest (around 44 ha) took about € 8,000,000 [(W. Murphy)](http://www.coford.ie/media/coford/content/publications/projectreports/small-scaleforestryconference/Murphy.pdf). Adjusting for inflation, today (€ 1 in 2006 $\approx$ € 1.3 in 2024), that around € 10,400,000 [(Central Statistics Office, Ireland)](https://visual.cso.ie/?body=entity/cpicalculator). Thus, restoring and establishing recreation facilities in an 8 ha forest today, might cost around $\frac{10.4}{44} \times 1,000,000 =$ € 240,000.
* Therefore, establishing recreation facilities in a $1740.15 \text{ m}^2$ forest today, might cost around € 5220.45.
* If in a 8 ha forest, there are 30 people employed, such that they work for 2000 $hrs$ per week for a pay of $\text{Bc }10/hr$. Then, amount paid for maintenance each year could be around Bc 624,000 (amount paid to employees + amount paid for physical resources  (say 10% of initial fixed investment)). So, maintenance cost per year $= \boxed{\text{Bc } 624,000}$ per year.
* In 2022, it was estimated that the Irish forest receives 29,105,759 visits per annum with forest recreation being valued at €179,000,000 per annum. [(Department of Agriculture, Food And the Marine, 2022)](https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/crops/forestry/advice/Forest-Statistics-Ireland-2022.pdf) Thus, in the microworld, the amount charged may be $\frac{179000000}{29105759} =$ 6.15 coins that may be approximated to $8 \text{ coins/visit}$ after accounting for inflation [(CPI Inflation Calculator, Central Statistics Office Ireland)](https://visual.cso.ie/?body=entity/cpicalculator).

## Non Timber Forest Products
* A good number for wild mushroom yield from a European forest can be 44.5 kg/ha/year based on yield from a Spanish forest. [(J.Miina et. al., 2014)](https://star-tree.eu/images/visuals/reader/7_promoting%20wild%20mushroom%20yields.pdf)
* On average, around 52.5 kg/ha/year of honey can be harvested from a forest based on numbers from Sudan. [(E. Elzaki and G. Tian, 2019)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10457-019-00478-1)
* On average, around 20kg of honey can be harvested from one bee hive per year. [(D. Flanagan, Teagasc)](https://www.teagasc.ie/rural-economy/rural-development/diversification/bee-keeping-and-honey-production/)
* In Europe, density of wild honey bee colonies have been estimated to be around $0.26/km^2 = 0.0026$ colonies per $ha$. [(O. D. Visick, F. L. W. Ratnieks, 2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37841222/) 
* With intensive berry picking, it is possible for a group of people to harvest around $10 \text{ kg}$ of wild berries per year by foraging close to home. [(M. Riedl et. al., 2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/11/10/1114)
* It may be possible to harvest wild mushrooms 3 times during the year. [(Field & Forest)](https://www.fieldforest.net/category/planting-and-harvesting-timelines) [(Quora, 2021)](https://www.quora.com/How-many-times-can-you-harvest-mushrooms)
* With more than 159 million hectares of forest, the EU had 3.2 million people working in activities related to forestry and wood-based industry in 2021. [(Eurostat, 2023)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/edn-20230321-1)
* Annual cost if the forest was 8 hectares in size.
	* It takes a person a little over 20 hours to cover one acre by foot [(V. Liu, Quora, 2021)](https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-it-take-a-person-to-walk-an-acre). A hectare is 2.5 acres. 
	* Let an employee take 50 hours to harvest (forage & gather) products (mushrooms, honey, berries) from one acre of forest. Then, to cover one hectare, they would need to work for 125 hours. 
	* If the employee is expected to work for 40 hours a week [(A. Meehan, Aisling Meehan Agriculture Solicitors, Teagasc)](https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/animals/dairy/2-aisling-meehan-presentation-v2.pdf), then no. of work hours possible in a year is $40 \times 52 = 2080 \text{ hrs}$.
	* If the forest spans 8 ha [(SWS Forestry)](https://swsforestry.ie/why-plant/forestry-facts/) and a worker needs to cover the equivalent of the whole forest 3 times a year for harvests, then they would need to work for $125 \times 8 \times 3 = 3000 \text{ hrs}$. This is more than how much 1 person can work in a year. 
	* So, a pair of people working for 1500 hours a year can cover a 8 ha forest 3 times a year for foraging. 
	* Let there be 20 such pairs of people employed. So, the work force would contain 40 people. This is close to the average no. of people working in forestry in the EU as of numbers from 2021 $\approx 50$ people per ha of forest [(Eurostat, 2023)](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/edn-20230321-1).
	* Thus, amount to be paid to employees per year to harvest NTFPs $= \boxed{\text{Bc }600,000}$.

## Miscellaneous

Research ecologists have used the term “old growth” to describe forests dominated by trees greater than 150 years old. [(C. Neff, 2021)](https://njaudubon.org/what-does-old-growth-really-mean-it-depends-installment-1-of-6/)

The cultivation and drainage of organic soil causes significant CO2 emissions. For 2019, EU Member States reported a loss of carbon from 17.8Mha of land with organic soil (**4.2% of the total land area**), corresponding to emissions of 108Mt CO2, while 387.6Mha of mineral soil secured net removals of 44Mt CO2.
