Users can discover concepts related to forest management and carbon capture as modelled within the microworld that this tool presents, while trying to achieve goals set as part of 3 challenges as follows.
## Challenge 1
$$
\text{How low a } CO_2 \text{ target can you set and meet?} \qquad [1]
$$
***Associated User Experience (UX)***
1. Toggle challenge mode OFF.
2. Set a $CO_2$ target within an allowed range.
3. Formulate a forest management plan using the planner. Available controls at this stage $=$ management action planner.
4. Toggle challenge mode ON.
5. Play simulation.
6. If $CO_2$ levels in the atmosphere never go higher than set target for the entirety of the simulation, then PASS $\Rightarrow$ progress to challenge 2.
7. Else, FAIL $\Rightarrow$ Please try again.
## Challenge 2
$$
\text{How high an income target can you set and meet?} \qquad [2]
$$
***Associated UX***
1. Toggle challenge mode OFF.
2. Set an income per rotation target within an allowed range. Available controls at this stage $=$ management action planner $+$ income dependency wheel.
3. Formulate a forest management plan using the planner.
4. Toggle challenge mode ON.
5. Play simulation.
6. If income is $\geq$ set target value for every set rotation throughout the simulation, then PASS $\Rightarrow$ progress to challenge 3.
7. Else, FAIL $\Rightarrow$ Please try again.
## Challenge 3
$$
\text{How low a } CO_2 \text{ target and high an income target can you set and meet simultaneously?} \qquad [3]
$$
***Associated UX***
1. Toggle challenge mode OFF.
2. Set a $CO_2$ target within an allowed range.
3. Set an income per rotation target within an allowed range.
4. Formulate a forest management plan using the planner. Available controls at this stage $=$ management action planner $+$ income dependency wheel.
5. Toggle challenge mode ON.
6. Play simulation.
7. If  $CO_2$ levels in the atmosphere $\lt$ the set target throughout the simulation AND if income is $\geq$ set target value at the end of every rotation throughout the simulation, then PASS $\Rightarrow$ Congratulations! You've cleared every level!
8. Else, FAIL $\Rightarrow$ Please try again.
