This document describes some key mechanisms in the application that users can interact with and how it works under the hood.
## Income Dependency
Forests present more income streams than just timber such as non-timber forest products, ecosystem services and hunting and fishing. These alternate sources of income from forests are, however, less dependable than timber. Thus, a balance must be struck between dependence of timber based and non timber based income from forests.

***Interactive Element:*** The Income Dependency Wheel (IDW) is a pie chart. Each segment in the pie chart represents a stream of income. The size of the slice can be altered by the user by clicking and dragging handles to adjust dependency on each income source. Reducing dependency on one source of income, will increase dependency on another one.

***Under the Hood:*** Each income stream will be affected slightly differently as a consequence of altering the IDW.
