Users can discover concepts related to forest management and carbon capture as modelled within the microworld that this tool presents, while trying to achieve goals set as part of 3 challenges as follows.

## The Learner's Journey

1. **Challenge 1 =** Get most income from timber. <font color="8888FF">(1 - 1.5 hrs)</font>
	* **Strategy 1:** Chop as much as possible with rotation period $= 40 \Rightarrow$ soon, all trees die. <font color="FF8888">FAIL</font>
	* **Strategy 2:** Make the rotation period larger $= 80 \Rightarrow$ income target could be increased to $100 M$.
	* **Strategy 3:** Chopping as much as possible, really quickly with rotation period $= 10 \Rightarrow$ target income comes down to $< 1M$. Overall funds at the end of the simulation is also lesser if all trees are chopped down as soon as they mature.
	* **Strategy 4:** Deciduous trees are worth more. Planting is cheap. So, maybe selling all coniferous trees and replacing with deciduous trees with rotation period of 40 years might be a better idea. **Result:** Challenge passed with total income $= 1395.3M$.
	* **Strategy 5:** 20 year rotation period. Income per rotation target $= 9.9M$. Over first 3 rotations, clear all coniferous trees and always plant deciduous trees in any empty spot. Cut majority of the mature trees and leave some trees to get to the old growth state before chopping them as well. Repeat. **Result:** 1645.5M overall. Min per rotation income was 10 M and max was 238.7M. <font color="88FF88">BEST</font>
2. **Challenge 2 =** Consider CO2 levels only. How low of a target can you set and meet? Try to keep concentration in green zone as much as possible. <font color="8888FF">(1 - 1.5 hrs)</font>
	* **Strategy 1:** No management. **Result:** Min CO2 target = 500 ppm.
	* **Strategy 2:** Target CO2 = 500 ppm. 20 years rotation period. Some management. Chop all old growth/senescent trees. **Result**: Chopping older trees leads to quick release of CO2. <font color="FF8888">FAIL</font>
	* **Strategy 3:** Chop very few (1 to 3) senescent or old trees occasionally when CO2 ppm drops a lot. Alternatively chop more no. of mature trees at same situation (never more than 10 though). **Result:** From rotation 3 onwards, CO2 ppm remained at green - blue level. Target CO2 was 455 ppm. 
	* **Strategy 4:** Chop fewer trees more frequently at a rotation period of 10 to stop mass death due to too little co2. Also, plant deciduous trees when CO2 is nearing too low if possible.  **Result:** From rotation 3 onwards, CO2 ppm remained at green - blue level. Target CO2 was 455 ppm. <font color="88FF88">BEST</font>
3. **Challenge 3 =** Try to gain maximum income while minimizing CO2 concentration. Set highest income target and lowest CO2 target as you can with Timber as only source of income.
	* **Strategy 1:** Strategy 5 from 1. **Result:** Lowest CO2 target without failing is 950
	* **Strategy 2:** Strategy 4 from 2. **Result:** Total funds at the end of this is lower at 898.3M. Lots of rotations with no income. So income target needs to be 0 for this to work.  
	* **Strategy 3:** Strategy 2. Small rotations of 10 years. In most years, chop very few old growth or senescent trees. In come years, the CO2 concentration is very low. Big harvest in those years. **Result:** This led to better income of 1350.9M in total. But per income target needed to be lowered to 1M and CO2 target needed to be increased to 550 ppm. <font color="88FF88">BEST</font>
4. **Challenge 4 =** Try to gain maximum income while minimizing CO2 concentration. Set highest income target and lowest CO2 target as you can with Timber as only source of income with human induced fossil fuel emissions.
	 * **Strategy 1:** Same as Strategy 3 from 3 but with fossil fuel emissions being 9.5 Gt per year. **Result:** CO2 target had to be raised to 1300 ppm. Income per rotation target had to be lowered to 500k.
	 * **Strategy 2:** <font color="FF8888">No management with fossil fuel emissions being 9.5 Gt per year. Result: CO2 target had to be raised to 1300 ppm. Income per rotation target had to be lowered to 0.</font>
5. **Challenge 5 =** Try to gain maximum income while minimizing CO2 concentration. Set highest income target and lowest CO2 target as you can with Timber as only source of income with human induced fossil fuel emissions. Now, however, you may explore use of other streams of income like forest recreation and NTFPs.

What have I learned?
* Hardwood plantation + short rotation $\Rightarrow$ highest income but also high CO2 concentration.
* Short rotations with very little management each rotation is the best trade-off scenario.
