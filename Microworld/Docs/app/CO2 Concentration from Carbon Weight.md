Let volume of the atmosphere be $4.2\times10^{18} \text{ m}^3$ [(Quora, 2024)](https://www.quora.com/How-much-m3-is-the-volume-of-air-on-Earth-from-the-ground-to-the-atmosphere) and let the weight of carbon in the air be $750\text{ GtC}$ [(S. Rackley, Science Direct, 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/global-carbon-cycle). Further, let all carbon in the air be in the form of $CO_2$. 

Given these assumptions, the concentration of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere can be computed by following steps given below.
## Step 1: Mass

This step involves calculating the mass of $CO_2$ corresponding to $750 \text{ GtC}$.

Atomic mass of carbon $(C) = 12\text{ g/mol}$.

Molar mass of $CO_2 (C + 2 \times O) \approx 12 + 2 \times 16 \approx 44 \text{ g/mol}$.

The ratio of the mass of $CO_2$ to the mass of carbon in $CO_2$ is $\frac{44}{12}=3.67$.

$\therefore$ Mass of $CO_2$ corresponding to $750 \text{ GtC} = 750 \times 3.67 = 2752.5 \text{ GtCO2}$

Since $1 \text{ Gt} = 10^{15} \text{ g}$, $2752.5 \text{ GtCO2} = 2752.5 \times 10^{15} \text{ gCO2}$.
## Step 2: Molar Mass

The no. of moles of $CO_2 = \frac{2752.5 \times 10^{15} \text{ g}}{44 \text{ g/mol}} = 6.26 \times 10^{16} \text{ moles}$. 
## Step 3: Volume

As per the ideal gas law, at standard temperature and pressure (STP), 1 mole of gas occupies $22.414 \text{ L}$.

Thus, total volume of $CO_2 = 6.26 \times 10^{16} \text{ L} \times 22.414 \text{ L/mole} = 1.4 \times 10^{18} \text{ L}$.

In $m^3$, volume of $CO_2 = 1.4 \times 10^{18} \text{ L} \times 10^{-3} \text{ m}^3\text{/L} = 1.4\times10^{15}\text{ m}^3$
## Step 4: Concentration

Using now available values, concentration of $CO_2$ in parts per million $(ppm)$, can be computed as follows. 
$$
Con_{CO_2}=\frac{\text{Volume of }CO_2}{\text{Volume of Atmosphere}}\times10^6
$$
$$
\Rightarrow Con_{CO_2} = \frac{1.4\times10^{15}\text{ m}^3}{4.2\times10^{18}\text{ m}^3}\times10^6 = \frac{1.4}{4.2}\times10^3=0.33333\times10^3=333.33 \text{ ppm}
$$
