This document shall document the flow of ideas and concepts that shall drive research.
1. Why do we need to simulate forests in order to teach about their management? What are the advantages of doing this?
	*  Real forests take years to grow. Time is a limiting factor that microworlds can help overcome.
	* No real world risk of experiments.
1. Why are microworlds promising as teaching tools?
	* Constructivist learning.
	* More engaging ("fun").
2. Why go for a web based application?
	* No installation required.
	* More accessible.
3. What technologies used? Why?
	*  Can either use a framework or implement using vanilla JS + HTML + CSS.
	*  Tailwind CSS.
	*  D3.js.
	* No backend.

| Vanilla JS                                | NextJS (ReactJS)                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| + More OOP friendly.                      | + Functional programming.                        |
| + More lightweight.                       | + Reusable components.                           |
| - Harder to deploy.                       | + Easier to deploy.                              |
| - Creating reusable components is harder. | - Pure OOP with classes and inheritance is hard. |
|                                           | - Bulkier.                                       |

4. How much detail does the microworld capture? Why?
