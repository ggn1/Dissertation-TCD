**CO2 Levels**
[(A. Moseman, 2021)](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/what-ideal-level-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-human-life)
* $CO_2$ levels during human evolution $\approx 200 \text{ to } 300 \text{ ppm}$.
* Pre-industrial $CO_2$ levels $\approx 280 \text{ ppm}$.
* $20^{th}$ century levels $\approx 300 \text{ to } 350 \text{ ppm}$.
* Level of $CO_2$ which would push the world past its target for avoiding dangerous climate change $\approx 430 \text{ ppm}$.
[(Z. Hausfather, 2019)](https://www.carbonbrief.org/extreme-co2-levels-could-trigger-clouds-tipping-point-and-8c-of-global-warming/)
* One of our best estimates of a $CO_2$ level that would be a tipping point beyond which global temperatures would rise by 8 to 10 $\degree C \approx 1200 \text{ ppm}$.
[(Daily CO2, 2024)](https://www.co2.earth/daily-co2)
* As of May 16 2024, $CO_2$ levels in the atmosphere $\approx 426.95 \text{ ppm}$.
[CO2.earth](https://www.co2.earth/co2-ice-core-data), [(Lüthi et al, 2008)](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7193/abs/nature06949.html)
* Lowest known $CO_2$ level ever, based on findings from ice cores $\approx 172 \text{ ppm}$ (650,000 to 800,000 years ago).

**Temperature Associated with $CO_2$**
* Global temperature in 2022 was around $14.76 \degree C$. [(NCEI NOAA, 2022)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/monthly-report/global/202213)
* Amount of $CO_2$ in the atmosphere in 2022 $\approx 421.72 \text{ ppm}$. [(CO2.earth)](https://rechneronline.de/temperatur/global-warming.php)
* [Global warming calculator](https://rechneronline.de/temperatur/global-warming.php).
* A general estimate is that every time $CO_2$ concentrations rise by 10 ppm, the mean global temperature increases by 0.1 °C. [(Fakta o klimatu, 2022)](https://factsonclimate.org/infographics/concentration-warming-relationship)

Based on $CO_2$ and temperature related data above, a world condition scale has been developed for the microworld as follows.
