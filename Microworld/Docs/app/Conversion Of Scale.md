To map a number from one scale $x$ to another $y$, a linear transformation as given below can be used. 

Given an original scale that goes from aa to bb, and you want to map it to a new scale that goes from cc to dd, you can use the following formula.
$$
y = \frac{(x - a) \times (d - c)}{b - a} + c
$$Here:
* $x$ is the number on the original scale.
* $y$ is the corresponding number on the new scale.
* $a$ and $b$ are the minimum and maximum values of the original scale.
- $c$ and $d$ are the minimum and maximum values of the new scale.
