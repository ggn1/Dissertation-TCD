The environment is composed of the atmosphere, [[Land]] and carbon reservoirs.

There are 5 carbon reservoirs as follows. Carbon moves between these to emulate the [[Carbon Cycle]].
1. **Soil**: 1.  The soil holds carbon in the form of organic material (plant/animal remains, microbes, etc.) or minerals. The starting amount of carbon in the soil $= \boxed{0 \text{ g}}$ . Soil carbon content is roughly 30 to 90 tC/ha of which cultivated soil can lose approximately 3 tC/ha/year. Thus, in this microworld, $\frac{3}{(30+90)/2} \times 100 = 5\%$ of the carbon in the soil is released into the air each year.
2. **Fossil Fuels**: Of all the CO2 locked away in the earth, around 5 to 10000 Gt is present as fossil fuels. Thus, in this microworld, the starting amount of carbon in the fossil fuels reservoir $= \boxed{10000e+15 \text{ g}}$ [(S. Rackley, Science Direct, 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/global-carbon-cycle).
3. **Atmosphere:** Volume of air on earth at sea level is around 4.2 billion $km^3$ [(A. E. Hall, 2017)](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-volume-of-air-in-Earth%E2%80%99s-atmosphere-and-volume-of-water-on-Earth) which is equal to $\boxed{5.3e+22 \text{ L}}$.  The mass of the atmosphere is about 5.1e+18 kg [(NASA)](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html) $= \boxed{5.1e+21 \text{ g}}$. Given weight of carbon in the air and the volume of the atmosphere, the concentration of $CO_2$ in parts per million ($PPM$). Simply, it s computed as $\frac{mass_{solute}}{mass_{solution}} \times 1e+6$. From volume, it can be computed as demonstrated in [[CO2 Concentration]]. The [[CO2 Scale]] categorizes ranges of CO2 concentration in the air into different classes based on its implication on quality of human life after having accounted for associated climatic conditions.
4. **Vegetation**: The plants on land sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration refers to the process through which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and held in solid or liquid form. [(Oxford Languages)](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&sca_esv=bd5de69f547e2ef3&sca_upv=1&q=carbon+sequestration&si=ACC90nxFKxGIkEronL_t-_P1vo-ZJsK70JfOsn5CDUyBd0eHsIWlZqvD0F2uzkFaIvtab6wuU-Ql3LONo88jio_hZMU3sjhiLnyiyzb1YjmtriFBRWyuzdI2QtvPuQIPhWzNX5TKIe2s&expn.) The starting amount of carbon stored in live plants $= \boxed{0 \text{ g}}$ .
5. **Lumber**: This is a man-made reservoir. It refers to all wood that’s preserved in use (furniture, construction, etc.) and not burned for energy. When we preserve wood, we significantly slow down its breakdown and re-entry into the carbon cycle via natural decay. The starting amount of carbon stored in lumber $= \boxed{0 \text{ g}}$ .
6. **Hydrosphere**: Volume of water on earth is around 1.4 billion $km^3$ [(JeopardyTempest, 2017)](https://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/12077/how-much-atmoshphere-is-there-compared-to-land-and-water) which is equal to $\boxed{1.4e+21 \text{ L}}$. The mass of the hydrosphere is about 1.4e+21 kg [(NASA)](https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html) $= \boxed{1.4e+24 \text{ g}}$. Thus, volume of water in this microworld is $1.386e+18 \text{ m}^3$. The most active part of the ocean w.r.t the fast carbon cycle is the surface ocean. The surface area of our ocean is approximately 3.6e+14 $m^2$ [(NOAA, 2019)](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/explored.html). The water at the topmost layer of the ocean up to around 100 m deep is referred to as the surface ocean [(Woods Home Oceanographic Institution)](https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/). Thus, volume of the surface ocean may be estimated to be around $3.6e+16 \text{ m}^3$ which is around $\boxed{3\%}$ of the total volume.
The starting amounts of carbon are based on the composition of earth as mentioned in [(H. Riebeek, 2011)](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle).

OBSOLETE: The starting amounts of carbon are based on the composition of earth as estimated in [(S. Rackley, Science Direct, 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/global-carbon-cycle). Here, it is mentioned that the total carbon on earth is at least $\approx 650,002,700 \text{ GtC}$ where $GtC\Rightarrow$ Gigatonnes  of Carbon such that $1\text{ GtC} = 10^{12}\text{ kg}$, of which $650,000,000 \text{ GtC}$ is locked away in the earth's surface (glacial deposits, minerals, fossil fuels, oceans), $1400 \text{ GtC}$  is present in the soil, $550 \text{ GtC}$ may be found within plants and $750 \text{ GtC}$ is free, in the atmosphere. 

It is expected that once the simulation runs for 500 years and stabilizes, carbon composition of the microworld will be similar to that of earth.
