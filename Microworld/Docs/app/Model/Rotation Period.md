Trees may be felled or planted every X no. of years. This X is the ROTATION PERIOD. It exists to allow for management actions such as FELL and PLANT to be scheduled at the beginning of each rotation. This type of planning in rotations mimics real world practices.

Higginbottom, 2023)](https://www.studocu.com/in/document/sam-higginbottom-university-of-agriculture-technology-and-sciences/agroforestry-management/rotation/27330074).
