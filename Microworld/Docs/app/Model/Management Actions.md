Creating a new management action involves selecting the following.
* The action type.
* The type of tree (species, age) the action is to be applied to.
* The no. of trees that are to be affected.
* The year in which this action is to be executed.
* Whether this action is to repeated every rotation or not.

There are 2 types of management actions as follows.
1. **FELL :** Felling a tree sparks the following events.
	* 3000 coins is the max amount it will cost to fell a tree [(Grasshopper Services)](https://www.grasshopperservices.ie/tree-removal-cost/) for the biggest tree. This amount will be multiplied by percent of full growth the tree has reached at the time of chopping. Thus, felling cost = (height of the tree / max height) $\times 3000$.
	* Let 25% (roots (21.3% - [(H. He et. al, 2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344244004_Allometric_biomass_equations_for_12_tree_species_in_coniferous_and_broadleaved_mixed_forests_Northeastern_China)) + the stump and some foliage + branches) of that tree remains on land while the rest of it is harvested.
	* The tree that is harvested, is sold and used.
		* 50% of the tree is used to generate energy. [(Wisconsin Center for Environmental Education, 2020)](https://www.uwsp.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/keep-facts-wood.pdf)  All the carbon in this portion of the tree is immediately released back into the environment.
		* The remaining portion of the harvested tree is used as lumber. The carbon in this portion of the tree is locked away and removed from the world.
2. **PLANT :** Planting a tree involves the following.
	* Planting a tree costs 277 coins. [(A. Nita, 2023)](https://lawnlove.com/blog/cost-to-plant-tree/)
	* Tree is added to the land if a free spot is available.
