A planner keeps track of the user's current forest management plan. A plan is a mapping of years to [[Management Action]]s.

[[Target]]s set by the user is also maintained in the planner along with the [[Rotation Period]] setting.

The planner also contains switches which can be used to set whether other streams of income are to be considered or not.
