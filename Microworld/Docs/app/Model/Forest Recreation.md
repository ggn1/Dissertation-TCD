Forests may be opened up to the public for recreational use which can include forest trails, picnicking spots and other activities like camping. This can fetch money.
## Availability

As of 2022, there are 808,848 ha = 8088480000 $m^2$ of forest in Ireland. It is expected that these forests receive around  29105759 visits per annum [(Department of Agriculture, Food And the Marine, 2022)](https://www.teagasc.ie/media/website/crops/forestry/advice/Forest-Statistics-Ireland-2022.pdf).

Based on this, no. of visits per $m^2$ of forest per year may be computed as $= \frac{29105759}{8088480000} \approx {0.0036} \text{ visits/year/}m^2$.

Thus, on average, a 1740 $m^2$ forest in this microworld can be expected to receive around $\boxed{7 \text{ visits/year}}$. This can vary significantly, hence let $\sigma = 2.5$.

A normal curve shall determine no. of people that visit each year.

## Income

Income from forests open to public recreation may be generated via multiple means as follows.
* Admission/Parking Charge = €5 [(Beyond the Trees, Avondale)](https://www.beyondthetreesavondale.com/plan-your-visit/tickets-prices/),  [(Lough Key Forest Activity Park)](https://loughkey.ie/admission-prices/)
* Guided tours = €10 
* Special activities (Zip Lining, Mushroom Picking, etc.) = €20 to 40€ [(ZipIt, Farran Park)](https://zipit.ie/locations/farran-park/park-info/) [(Boda Borg, Lough Key Forest Park)](https://loughkey.ie/activities/boda-borg/) [(Beyond the Trees, Avondale)](https://www.beyondthetreesavondale.com/plan-your-visit/tickets-prices/)
* Group Events (Birthday Parties, Yoga, etc.) = €20 / individual [(The Forest Club)](https://www.theforestclub.ie/childrens-birthday-parties).

Assuming 1 of all visits to be guided tours, another 1 to be a special activity and the rest to be normal visits with 1 group (20 individuals) activity per year, income per year may be computed as $\boxed{10 + 30 + ((\text{no. of visits} - 2) \times 5) + 400 \text{ coins/year}}$.

## Expenditure

Opening up a forest for public recreation can involve establishment and maintenance of infrastructure.

Establishment of infrastructure would have associated one time expenses. In 2006, restoration of around 44 hectares = 440000 $m^2$ of forest land cost about €8000000 [(W. Murphy)](http://www.coford.ie/media/coford/content/publications/projectreports/small-scaleforestryconference/Murphy.pdf). Adjusting for change in currency value, in January 2024, that's around €10114114  [(CPI Inflation Calculator, Central Statistics Office Ireland)](https://visual.cso.ie/?body=entity/cpicalculator). Thus, in this microworld, the initial one-time cost to make forest land suitable for recreational activities can be considered to be around $\frac{10114114}{440000} \approx 23 \text{ coins}$ per $m^2$. 
Thus, for a 1740 $m^2$ forest, this would be around $\boxed{40020 \text{ coins}}$. If dependence on this stream is set to a value greater than 0, then this initial fixed amount will have to be paid in expenses.

Established infrastructure would also need to be maintained. Maintenance would require employees and also resources, both of which cost money. 

It was not possible to find definitive numbers that hint at how many employees may be required to maintain forest recreation facilities. This varies greatly. An estimate for no. of workers per $m^2$ of forest was arrived at for the microworld based on no. of people that Coillte, with around 4.4e+9 $m^2$ of managed forest land [(Coillte)](https://www.coillte.ie/our-business/our-divisions/forestry/), employs. In 2016, it employed around 862 people  [(Coillte, Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coillte). In 2021, this was around 840 people [(Irish River Project, 2023)](https://irishriverproject.com/2023/02/24/coillte-and-coillte-nature-average-number-of-employees-in-2021-and-2022/). Considering no. of employees to be 850 people, no. of people employed per $m^2$ may be computed as $\frac{850}{4.4e+9} = 1.93e-7 \text{ employees/}m^2$. Thus, no. of employees for the 1740 $m^2$ forest in the microworld $= 1740 \times 1.93e-7 = 0.00034$. 

If each employee works for 8 hours a day for 5 days a week for 52 weeks a year, then each employee works around 2080 hours a year. In Ireland, forest workers get paid around €18 per hour [(Salary Expert, June 2024)](https://www.salaryexpert.com/salary/job/forest-worker/ireland). Thus, maintenance cost due to employee wages per $m^2$ of forest for a 1740 $m^2$ forest can be computed as $0.00034 \times 2080 \times 18 \approx 13 \text{ coins/year}$.

Purchase of resources needed to maintain facilities every year would also contribute to maintenance cost. Once again, it is difficult to come across numbers for this. Thus, here it is assumed to be a fraction (1%) of the initial establishment cost = $0.01 \times 40020 \approx 400 \text{ coins/year}$.

Thus, total maintenance cost for a 1740 $m^2$ forest would be $400 + 13 = \boxed{413 \text{ coins/year}}$.
