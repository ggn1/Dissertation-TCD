Atmospheric CO2 concentration is expressed in Parts Per Million (ppm). This is the standard. PPM is a measure of the concentration of a substance in a solution or gas. It is a proportion, just like percent. 80 percent is 80 parts out of 100. 80 ppm is 80 parts out of 1,000,000. Here, CO2 concentration in ppm indicates the number of parts of CO2 per 1 million parts of the total air in the atmosphere. [(CO2 Meter, 2023)](https://www.co2meter.com/blogs/news/co2-ppm)

CO2 concentration in the microworld has been organized into a scale as shown below. Associated with each band in the scale, is a label and colour that is indicative of the expected quality of life for humans at that level of atmospheric CO2 concentration after considering corresponding climate change.

Similarly, photosynthetic efficiency was also organized into categories as follows.

Above scales were developed based on following information.
* Photosynthesis is more effective at CO2 concentrations ranging from 700 to 1800 with around 1000 being max efficiency. Beyond 1800, conditions may start to become toxic for plants. [(M. Poudel and B. Dunn, 2023)](https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/greenhouse-carbon-dioxide-supplementation.html)
* Below about 200 ppm concentration of CO2, photosynthesis is extremely difficult with it being impossible less than or equal to 150 ppm. [(Manitoba Govt.)](https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/crop-management/co2-supplement.html)
* $CO_2$ levels during human evolution $\approx 200 \text{ to } 300 \text{ ppm}$. [(A. Moseman, 2018)](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/what-ideal-level-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-human-life)
* Pre-industrial $CO_2$ levels $\approx 280 \text{ ppm}$. [(A. Moseman, 2021)](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/what-ideal-level-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-human-life)
* $20^{th}$ century levels $\approx 300 \text{ to } 350 \text{ ppm}$. [(A. Moseman, 2021)](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/what-ideal-level-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-human-life)
* Level of $CO_2$ which would push the world past its target for avoiding dangerous climate change $\approx 430 \text{ ppm}$. [(A. Moseman, 2021)](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/what-ideal-level-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-human-life)
* One of our best estimates of a CO2 level that would be a tipping point beyond which global temperatures would rise by 8 to 10$\degree C \approx 1200 \text{ ppm}$. [(Z. Hausfather, 2019)](https://www.carbonbrief.org/extreme-co2-levels-could-trigger-clouds-tipping-point-and-8c-of-global-warming/)
* Lowest known $CO_2$ level ever, based on findings from ice cores $\approx 172 \text{ ppm}$ (650,000 to 800,000 years ago). [(CO2.earth)](https://www.co2.earth/co2-ice-core-data), [(Lüthi et al, 2008)](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7193/abs/nature06949.html)

In above scales, when CO2 in the air falls below 200 ppm or rises above 1800 ppm, then this corresponds to impossible living conditions because at the lower end, photosynthesis becomes difficult and at the higher end, global warming is expected to lead inhospitable dangerous climatic conditions. In the microworld, while values in the 200 to 350 ppm range is ideal, CO2 level is regarded as manageable if it stays in the green, blue, or yellow range between 200 to 700 ppm. This range is wider than on Earth where tolerable levels would more likely be between 200 to 500 ppm. This is because unlike in the real world, in this microworld, shifts in atmospheric CO2 is more extreme because carbon absorbed and released by trees is scaled by a large number to allow for just 36 trees to mimic all forests on Earth and significantly impact carbon levels in the environment. If CO2 levels are in the 700 to 1200 ppm range, then it is considered bad for human life because this nears the expected tipping point beyond 1200 ppm beyond which it is difficult to revert to ideal conditions. Since this dangerous point is exceeded when atmospheric CO2 levels are in the 1200 to 1800 ppm range, this is categorized as “Very Bad” for human quality of life.
