Atmospheric CO2 concentration is expressed in Parts Per Million (ppm). This is the standard. PPM is a measure of the concentration of a substance in a solution or gas. It is a proportion, just like percent. 80 percent is 80 parts out of 100. 80 ppm is 80 parts out of 1,000,000. Here, this indicates the number of parts of CO2 per 1 million parts of the total air in the atmosphere. [(CO2 Meter, 2023)](https://www.co2meter.com/blogs/news/co2-ppm)

CO2 concentration in the microworld has been organized into a scale as shown below. Associated with each band in the scale, is a label that is indicative of the expected quality of life for humans at that level of atmospheric CO2 concentration after considering corresponding climate change.

The above scale was developed based on following information.
* Photosynthesis is more effective at CO2 concentrations ranging from 700 to 1800 with around 1000 being max efficiency. Beyond 1800, conditions may start to become toxic for plants. [(M. Poudel and B. Dunn, 2023)](https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/greenhouse-carbon-dioxide-supplementation.html)
* Below about 200 ppm concentration of CO2, photosynthesis is extremely difficult with it being impossible less than or equal to 150 ppm. [(Manitoba Govt.)](https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/crop-management/co2-supplement.html)
* $CO_2$ levels during human evolution $\approx 200 \text{ to } 300 \text{ ppm}$. [(A. Moseman, 2021)](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/what-ideal-level-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-human-life)
* Pre-industrial $CO_2$ levels $\approx 280 \text{ ppm}$. [(A. Moseman, 2021)](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/what-ideal-level-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-human-life)
* $20^{th}$ century levels $\approx 300 \text{ to } 350 \text{ ppm}$. [(A. Moseman, 2021)](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/what-ideal-level-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-human-life)
* Level of $CO_2$ which would push the world past its target for avoiding dangerous climate change $\approx 430 \text{ ppm}$. [(A. Moseman, 2021)](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/what-ideal-level-carbon-dioxide-atmosphere-human-life)
* One of our best estimates of a CO2 level that would be a tipping point beyond which global temperatures would rise by 8 to 10$\degree C \approx 1200 \text{ ppm}$. [(Z. Hausfather, 2019)](https://www.carbonbrief.org/extreme-co2-levels-could-trigger-clouds-tipping-point-and-8c-of-global-warming/)
* Lowest known $CO_2$ level ever, based on findings from ice cores $\approx 172 \text{ ppm}$ (650,000 to 800,000 years ago). [(CO2.earth)](https://www.co2.earth/co2-ice-core-data), [(LÃ¼thi et al, 2008)](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7193/abs/nature06949.html)
