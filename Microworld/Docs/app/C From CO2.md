Let $\text{Mass of }CO_2 = 37.15 \text{ GtCO2}$ have been released into the atmosphere. The $\text{Mass of }C$ this adds to the atmosphere may be computed as follows.

* $\text{Molecular weight of }CO_2 = 44\text{ g/mol}$
* $\text{Molecular weight of } C = 12 \text{ g/mol}$

$$
\text{Mass of C} = \text{Mass of }CO_2 \times \frac{\text{Molecular weight of }C}{\text{Molecular weight of }CO_2} = 37.15 \times \frac{12}{44} = 12.66 \text{ GtC}
$$
